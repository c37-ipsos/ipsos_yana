## Executive Summary

Ipsos represents a significant opportunity for Codename 37. Yana, a UX Research Leader at Ipsos, was introduced through Mark and participated in an introductory meeting on October 31, 2025. The conversation revealed that Ipsos is a **large global research organization with 17 lines of business** actively evaluating AI solutions through RFI/RFP processes.

The key opportunity lies in helping Ipsos build an **intelligence layer** that leverages their 60+ years of research data, proprietary frameworks, and methodologies. Jake's technical vision of deep learning models (versus reliance on LLMs alone) resonated strongly with Yana's understanding of their needs.

**Recommended Approach:** Position Codename 37 as the partner who can help Ipsos create custom machine learning and deep learning models trained on their intellectual property, enabling them to "dust their competitors" through superior AI-powered research capabilities.

## Strategic Value Propositions

### Jake's Core Vision for Ipsos (From October 31 Meeting)

#### 1. The Future State
> "You and your organization will probably become, in the next five years, 50% AI agents and bots versus people. I view the future consultant, future UXer as a rockstar person surrounded by lots of AI capability."

- Ipsos will be 50/50 AI agents vs humans within 5 years
- UX researchers become orchestrators of AI capability
- Agents access an "intelligence layer" for context and memory

#### 2. The Technology Shift
> "Your industry will be defined by its use of machine learning models, deep learning, neural networks, and transformers, especially for your qualitative side... not LLMs. LLMs will become the minor part of your world."

- **Machine Learning** = Pattern recognition across massive datasets
- **Deep Learning** = Making connections, like information architecture in microseconds
- **LLMs** = Limited role for summaries and basic tasks
- **Transformers** = Custom models encoding Ipsos' unique methods

#### 3. The Intelligence Layer
> "Hidden in your processes is the mathematics for how you'll end up creating your own [models]... Your intellectual property can now all be built in what I'll call the intelligence layer of your institution."

- Convert Ipsos frameworks, workflows, and methods into trainable models
- Build persistent systems that constantly learn and remember
- Create competitive moat through proprietary model development

#### 4. Infrastructure Reality
> "Companies don't understand what's coming in terms of AI infrastructure... In your world, you're going to be training 50 to 100 models at a time with your new ideas."

- Need robust infrastructure for continuous model training
- Models "go bad over time" - requires operational management
- Hundreds/thousands of models in production driving agents

### Key Differentiators to Emphasize
1. **We build intelligent systems, not just deploy LLMs**
2. **We help you own your AI future with proprietary models**
3. **We architect for the coming spatial computing era**
4. **We blend qualitative and quantitative through deep learning**
5. **We prepare you for 50-100 concurrent model operations**

---

## Technical Recommendations Made

### Architecture Recommendations
1. Build an intelligence layer combining:
   - Graph database for relationships
   - Vector database for semantic search
   - Custom machine learning models for pattern recognition
   - Deep learning models for connection-making

2. Start with open source models, enhance with Ipsos IP (30%+ proprietary sauce)

3. Create smaller, focused models for specific tasks vs one giant model

4. Implement persistent memory systems that learn continuously

### Training Strategy
- Train on both frameworks AND successful outcomes
- "AI likes to see the successful output" - use exemplary work
- Encode methodologies as mathematical models in transformers

### Infrastructure Recommendations
- Plan for training 50-100 models simultaneously
- Prepare for operational model management (models degrade)
- Consider compute costs - current cloud models don't scale affordably
- Build for on-prem capability to control costs and security

### Tool Strategy
- Don't over-rely on LLMs - they serve limited purposes
- Build specific models for specific jobs ("snapshots")
- Highly efficient models that run on existing hardware
- Follow the "deep seek phenomenon" - efficiency over brute force

## Competitive Positioning

### Against Large Consulting Firms
From the October 31 meeting:
> "We're really sick of working with these consulting firms, especially the top five, who are bidding and winning projects with us, but they're learning on our dime. They don't have the expertise they say they do."

**Position Codename 37 as:**
- Already expert, not learning on client time
- Small, agile, responsive vs bureaucratic
- Built for AI era, not retrofitting traditional consulting

### Against Generic AI Vendors
**Position Codename 37 as:**
- Understanding that LLMs are not the complete answer
- Expertise in deep learning and neural networks for research
- Building sustainable, proprietary capability (not vendor dependency)
- Focused on their specific industry (research/UX) not generic solutions

### Against Internal IT
**Position Codename 37 as:**
- Moving faster than internal teams can adapt
- Bringing outside expertise without IT queue delays
- Educating and enabling, not replacing internal capability

> "We can do quant, scale, qualitative research in five markets in a matter of a week."

> "The adoption rates in Brazil and India are way higher than the US and France because they see the happy rosy side of it."

> "For innovation, it's hard to get innovation out of the past. You've got to have people projecting into the future."

### From Jake (Value Propositions)
> "The difference is this time... Now he has AI. And now he can do it at 90% less cost."

> "If I was advising you somehow, I'd be like, get going on the path, continue down the LLM train, but your real value, how you're going to dust your competitors is in the deep learning machine learning side."

> "Your whole structure for how you get to that outcome is wildly different and a different mathematical model."

> "AI is not going to take your job. It's someone with my skill set who's going to take your job."

### From Mike (Relationship Building)
> "If there's things going on that we should be connecting or being at to learn, it would be great to know. Because it's hard to know what's a credible event and what's a waste of time."
