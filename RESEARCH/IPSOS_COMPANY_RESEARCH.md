## Sales Intelligence Insights

### Opportunities for Codename 37

#### 1. Intelligence Layer Architecture
Ipsos has sophisticated AI tools but they appear to be point solutions. There's an opportunity to help them build a unified intelligence layer that connects their various data sources and AI capabilities.

**Evidence:**
- They use multiple cloud providers (Azure, Google Cloud, AWS)
- They have separate tools (Facto, Synthesio, PersonaBot, etc.)
- No evidence of unified graph/vector database architecture
- Their 40+ years of data could be much more valuable with proper architecture

#### 2. Deep Learning for Research
Jake's vision of deep learning and custom models for research aligns with where Ipsos is heading but may not yet be fully realized.

**Evidence:**
- They focus heavily on LLMs through Facto
- No mention of custom machine learning models trained on their IP
- Their innovation focus is on GenAI applications
- Gap between their AI tools and true deep learning capability

#### 3. Leadership Transition Window
The departures of Chairman Truchot and CFO Lévy create organizational change that may open doors for new partnerships and initiatives.

**Timing Consideration:** February-June 2026 may be a window as new leadership establishes priorities.

#### 4. US Market Challenges
With US revenue down 5% in 2024, there may be appetite for differentiated capabilities to improve US performance.

#### 5. UX Research Division
Yana's division is a smaller service line within the 17-line organization. This means:
- Less bureaucracy than larger divisions
- More agility for innovation
- Need to self-serve on technology
- Potential frustration with internal IT support

### Messaging Alignment

| Ipsos Priority | Codename 37 Message |
|----------------|---------------------|
| AI Innovation | "We build the intelligence layer that makes your AI tools smarter" |
| Data Integration | "Unify your 40+ years of data into a competitive weapon" |
| Speed to Insight | "Custom models that give you answers competitors can't access" |
| Research Quality | "Deep learning captures the nuances that LLMs miss" |
| Global Scale | "Architecture that works across your 90 markets" |

### Competitive Positioning vs Ipsos' Current Tools

| Ipsos Has | Codename 37 Adds |
|-----------|------------------|
| LLM-based tools (Facto) | Custom deep learning models |
| Point solution AI | Unified intelligence layer |
| Generic AI capabilities | Models trained on Ipsos IP |
| Social listening (Synthesio) | Graph-based relationship intelligence |
| AI personas (PersonaBot) | Persistent learning systems |

### Key Contacts to Develop

Beyond Yana, based on the organizational structure:
- CEO North America (unnamed in research)
- Chief Client Officer
- Head of Innovation/Technology (likely exists but not named)
- UX Research leadership beyond Yana

### Potential Entry Points

1. **UX Research pilot** - Start with Yana's division for quick win
2. **Innovation partnership** - Position under their innovation focus
3. **US market initiative** - Help address US performance challenges
4. **Research efficiency** - Show how intelligence layer accelerates research

### Timing Considerations

| Period | Opportunity |
|--------|-------------|
| **Now - Feb 2026** | Build relationship before leadership transition |
| **Feb - June 2026** | New leadership may seek new initiatives |
| **Summer 2025** | Horizons 2030 conclusions announced |
| **Ongoing** | Ipsos actively acquiring - could position as capability vs company |
