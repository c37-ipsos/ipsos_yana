## The 60-Second Brief

**Ipsos** is a €2.4B French market research giant operating in 90 countries with 20,000 employees. They're the **#1 most innovative** research company (GRIT rankings) and heavily investing in AI, but their tools are point solutions - not a unified intelligence layer. They're going through **major leadership transition** (Chairman leaving Feb 2026, CFO departed) and struggling in the **US market (-5% in 2024)**. Yana leads their UX Research division, which is a smaller service line that has to self-serve on technology.

## Talking Points That Resonate

**Say This:** | **Because:**
-------------|-------------
"Intelligence layer that unifies your AI tools" | They have point solutions, not integration
"Custom models on YOUR 40 years of data" | They use generic LLMs, not proprietary ML
"Deep learning for research nuance" | LLMs miss qualitative subtlety
"Architecture for your 90-market scale" | They need global consistency
"Help your US business recover" | -5% in 2024, real pain point

---

## Avoid These Topics

- Don't criticize their existing AI tools (Facto is widely adopted)
- Don't assume all divisions have same culture
- Don't position as replacing Facto - position as enhancing it
- Don't ignore their #1 innovation ranking

---

## Timing Window

| When | Why It Matters |
|------|----------------|
| **Now** | Build relationship before Feb leadership change |
| **Feb-June 2026** | New leadership sets priorities |
| **Summer 2025** | Horizons 2030 strategy announced |
