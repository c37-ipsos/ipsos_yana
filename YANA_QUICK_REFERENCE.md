4. **Global Viability** - Will it work in Brazil, India?
5. **Clear ROI** - Demonstrate value quickly

### Pain Points
- IT queue delays frustrate her
- Only 3 people internally "get it"
- Smart people who resist change
- Complexity of current AI tools
- Job security concerns for team

### What Excites Her
- AI moderation for qualitative research
- Scaling research across 5 markets in a week
- Possibility of skipping manual video reviews
- Deep learning concept (once explained)
- Building proprietary capability

## Conversation Starters

**To Build Rapport:**
- Ask about the POV research she was releasing
- Reference her global work (Brazil, India findings)
- Acknowledge accessibility work (Zoom preference)
- Ask about Outset AI partnership progress

**To Advance Deal:**
- "What happened with the agentic AI RFP?"
- "Who else should be part of this conversation?"
- "What's the internal appetite for an AI initiative?"
- "Did the video/site help explain our approach?"
