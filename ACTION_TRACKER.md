## Commitments Made to Yana

These were promised during the October 31 meeting:

2. **Share Intelligence** - "We'll let you know if we run across any [conferences/events] that would be worth your time."

3. **Stay Connected** - "Hopefully next time Jake and I are out there, we'd love to meet with you."

1. **Send POV Research** - "I will send over the two POVs that we've done so far... AI at home and AI at work."

## Notes for Next Contact

**Key points to reinforce:**
1. We understand UX research is not going away - AI amplifies, not replaces
2. Deep learning + ML is their competitive advantage, not LLMs
3. Their 60 years of data is a goldmine for training proprietary models
4. We can help them skip ahead - they asked "what can we skip?"
5. Global scalability is solvable with right architecture

**Questions to ask:**
1. What happened with the RFI/RFP process for agentic solutions?
2. How is the Outset AI partnership going?
3. What's the appetite internally for a bigger AI initiative?
4. Who else should we be talking to?

**Topics to avoid:**
- Don't oversell complexity
- Don't assume they know technical terms
- Don't dismiss their current tools (Gemini gems work for them)
