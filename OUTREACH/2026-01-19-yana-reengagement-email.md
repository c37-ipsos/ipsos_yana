## Email Body

Hi Yana,

Happy New Year! I hope the holidays treated you well and that 2026 is off to a great start.

I've been thinking about our conversation back in October—particularly your point about researchers needing the "easy button" and not being able to manage 20 different AI tools. That really stuck with me.

Jake and I put together something specifically for you and your team. It's a site that captures our vision for how Codename 37 could partner with Ipsos to build the intelligence layer we discussed:

**https://c37-ipsos.github.io/ipsos_yana/**

We've also done quite a bit of research on Ipsos since we last spoke—your AI initiatives, the Horizons 2030 strategy, and where the UX research space is heading. It's only reinforced our belief that there's a real opportunity here to help you "dust the competition" with proprietary AI capability.

I'd love to reconnect and hear what's been happening on your end. Would you have 30 minutes in the next couple of weeks to catch up?

Just reply to this email or reach me directly at mbrendon@codename37.ai.

Looking forward to it,

**Mike Brendon**
CEO, Codename 37
mbrendon@codename37.ai

P.S. — You mentioned wanting to share those POV documents on AI adoption. Still very interested if you're able to send them along!

## Email Strategy Notes

### Key Elements
- **Warm, personal tone** - Not salesy, feels like a genuine reconnection
- **Specific callback** - References "easy button" from October conversation to show we listened
- **Value-first approach** - Leads with the site we built specifically for her
- **Demonstrates effort** - Shows we've done research on Ipsos
- **Soft CTA** - Asks for 30 minutes, not a hard sell
- **P.S. hook** - Creates additional reason to respond (POV documents)

### References from October Meeting
- "Researchers can't manage 20 gems. They can manage one or two... it has to be easy."
- "How you're going to dust your competitors is in the deep learning machine learning side."
- Yana promised to share POV documents on AI adoption

### Follow-up Plan
- If no response by January 27 → Send follow-up (Issue #4)
- If response received → Schedule discovery call (Issue #6)
