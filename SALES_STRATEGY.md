# Ipsos Sales Strategy
## Codename 37 Winning Approach

---

## Strategic Positioning

### The Big Idea
Help Ipsos transform their 60+ years of research IP and methodologies into a **proprietary intelligence layer** that creates sustainable competitive advantage through custom machine learning and deep learning models - not just another LLM deployment.

### Elevator Pitch
> "We help research organizations like Ipsos turn their unique methodologies and decades of data into custom AI models that competitors can't replicate. While everyone else is using the same LLMs, your team will have proprietary deep learning capabilities trained on what makes Ipsos uniquely valuable."

## Value Propositions by Pain Point

### Pain Point 1: "We can't keep up with AI changes"
**Solution:** Partner with experts who live this every day
- We track and filter the noise so you don't have to
- We tell you what matters vs what's hype
- We help you skip unnecessary steps ("what can we skip?")
- We've already made the mistakes so you don't have to

### Pain Point 2: "AI tools are too complex for our teams"
**Solution:** Build simple interfaces on sophisticated backends
- One or two tools, not 20 gems to manage
- Train researchers on outcomes, not technical details
- "Easy button" experience with enterprise capability
- We handle the complexity, they get the results

### Pain Point 3: "LLMs aren't giving us what we need"
**Solution:** Move beyond LLMs to custom deep learning
- LLMs are commodity - everyone has access
- Deep learning captures YOUR unique patterns
- Machine learning recognizes insights YOU care about
- Train models on YOUR successful research outcomes

### Pain Point 4: "We don't have internal support/resources"
**Solution:** We ARE your AI team
- No IT queue - we move at your pace
- Education and enablement included
- Help resistant team members through experience
- 35-minute "aha moment" with hands-on exposure

### Pain Point 5: "ROI is unclear"
**Solution:** Start with high-impact, measurable wins
- "You used to watch 100 videos - now you don't"
- Quant AND qual across 5 markets in a week
- Quantifiable time savings on repetitive tasks
- Build case for larger investment with quick wins

### Pain Point 6: "Will it work globally?"
**Solution:** Architecture designed for global scale
- Understanding of Brazil/India adoption dynamics
- Infrastructure that handles bandwidth constraints
- Smaller, efficient models that run anywhere
- Local processing options when needed

## Competitive Differentiation

### vs. Large Consulting Firms
| They Say | We Say |
|----------|--------|
| "We have AI expertise" | They're learning on your dime |
| "We have scale" | Bureaucracy slows everything |
| "We have methodology" | Their methodology is pre-AI |
| "We're trusted partners" | Trust doesn't mean competence |

**Our Angle:** "Wall Street Journal reports companies are 'sick of consulting firms learning on their dime.' We already know this space. We've built the systems. We teach it at the doctoral level."

### vs. Generic AI Vendors
| They Say | We Say |
|----------|--------|
| "Use our platform" | You'll be dependent on us forever |
| "LLMs solve everything" | LLMs have clear limitations |
| "Easy to get started" | Easy to start, hard to differentiate |
| "Everyone's using us" | That's exactly the problem |

**Our Angle:** "Everyone can access GPT-4. How does that differentiate Ipsos? We build capabilities you OWN - models trained on YOUR IP that competitors can never access."

### vs. Internal IT
| They Say | We Say |
|----------|--------|
| "We understand the business" | They're stuck in old paradigms |
| "Security is critical" | Overengineering slows everything |
| "We need to vet everything" | The market won't wait |
| "Our queue ensures quality" | Your researchers are frustrated |

**Our Angle:** "We work alongside IT, not against them. We bring expertise they don't have time to develop while respecting their governance needs."

## Sales Plays

### Play 1: The Vision Session
**Objective:** Expand the circle with Ipsos leadership

**Approach:**
- Use the video/site created for Yana
- Show what an intelligence layer looks like
- Demo Mosaic site as example of our capabilities
- Paint 5-year vision: rockstar researchers + AI agents

**Key Messages:**
- "Here's what we discussed with Yana"
- "Here's what this looks like in practice"
- "Here's where research is headed"
- "Here's how you get ahead of competitors"

### Play 2: The Quick Win
**Objective:** Land initial engagement with measurable impact

**Approach:**
- Identify one painful, repetitive task
- Automate it in weeks, not months
- Document time/cost savings meticulously
- Use success to justify larger engagement

**Candidate Use Cases:**
- Automated video analysis for qual research
- AI-powered research synthesis across markets
- Intelligent research assistant for analysts
- Automated insight extraction from transcripts

### Play 3: The Education Engagement
**Objective:** Position as trusted advisor through enablement

**Approach:**
- Offer workshop on AI for research organizations
- Include hands-on experience (35-minute aha moment)
- Cover LLM limitations and alternatives
- Introduce deep learning concepts practically

**Deliverables:**
- Half-day workshop for Yana's team
- Custom curriculum for research context
- Hands-on exercises with real tools
- Roadmap document for AI adoption

### Play 4: The Intelligence Layer Pilot
**Objective:** Prove the concept with meaningful scope

**Approach:**
- Select subset of Ipsos data/processes
- Build prototype intelligence layer
- Demonstrate graph + vector capabilities
- Show automated content generation

**Components:**
- Data ingestion and entity extraction
- Graph database for relationships
- Vector database for semantic search
- Bot/agent for researcher queries
- Sample automated outputs

## Objection Handling

### "We're already using Gemini gems"
> "That's smart - it's a great starting point for exploration. What we help with is the next level: custom models trained on YOUR methodologies that work the way Ipsos works, not generic models that work the same for everyone."

### "We went through an RFP process already"
> "Great - what did you learn? Most organizations find that off-the-shelf tools hit limits quickly. We complement those tools by building the custom layer that makes them smarter for YOUR specific use cases."

### "We don't have budget for this"
> "Let's start with a specific problem where we can demonstrate ROI in weeks. If we can show a 10x improvement on video analysis or synthesis, that builds the case for investment."

### "Our IT needs to approve everything"
> "Absolutely - we work within IT governance. In fact, we often help organizations improve their AI security posture. We can present to IT and address their concerns directly."

### "I'm worried about AI taking our jobs"
> "The data is clear: AI doesn't take jobs, people WITH AI take jobs from people WITHOUT it. We help your team become the people with AI capability, not the ones left behind."

### "This seems complicated"
> "Behind the scenes, yes - it's sophisticated technology. But the experience for your researchers is simple: ask questions, get answers, generate outputs. We handle the complexity so they don't have to."
