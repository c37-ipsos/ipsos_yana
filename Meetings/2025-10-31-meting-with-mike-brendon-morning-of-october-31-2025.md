## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The meeting centers on a discussion between team members, primarily Mike and Jake, reflecting on a proposal related to manufacturing and intelligent systems. The conversation begins with a focus on a project involving data unification and AI capabilities, initially thought to be an IoT initiative but later reframed as a broader data integration and intelligence effort. The participants express enthusiasm about the potential to build a system that processes and visualizes data in real time, positioning it as a transformative enterprise solution.

The discussion transitions into a reflective analysis of past organizational leadership at OST, particularly around Jim’s tenure and the company’s inability to evolve beyond its founder’s capabilities. The participants critique the leadership model, comparing it to a church structure—committee-based with a single figurehead—and discuss how this limited growth and innovation. The conversation then digresses into a philosophical and humorous discussion about modern church culture, community engagement, and the intersection of spirituality and entertainment.

Overall, the tone is candid, reflective, and occasionally humorous. The meeting blends strategic business reflection with cultural commentary, highlighting lessons about leadership, organizational evolution, and the importance of fostering growth beyond individual contributors.

## 📄 TRANSCRIPT

It's funny because as I read through, I just literally finished this. No, go ahead. Do what you got to do. I'm almost done. I just want to. Kind of want to know how well we know manufacturing for a phone like that. We know it really well. We know manufacturing like the back of our hand. Why? Well, he has a meeting with Saputo. Never heard of him. Never heard of him. But this is Kyle in Canada? Yeah. So we can look it up real quick. But no, I was reading through the setup, right, and what's going to be tested. And it was a little more complicated. Than you think to describe it. I was thinking the same thing when I was reading. I was like, geez, I would have wrote like one paragraph. We're here to test these things. So I didn't even think through how complex it actually is. It's a. Right. Well, it's just a. The win here is the holy grail of all enterprise stuff, right? That you are built. I mean, let's. In the end, Mike, we're building an intelligent system. That can rapidly process and analyze data. Visualize it how they want. And give them the data that they want in real time. I mean, that's what it is. And we haven't even talked to him about it. It's like. And it's not even worth putting those things in there. But it's like. Hey, guys. You ever heard of a machine learning model? You know what happens when we put this in your system? We can identify all the patterns. Like, oh, really? It's like. How do you think you're going to get to your outcome? And it just. It leads to the whole AI conversation. Which it's like. Win this. Right? And it's like. We can get this going. It's like. Hey, by the way, guys. This is what this starts to look like. And here's this AI future we can start to build for you. Here's how we can analyze these other pieces. By the way. In our conversations with you across your other systems. Do you realize we can do this with these two? And they're going to be like. Holy fuck. Really? Yeah. I mean, it's just. Go ahead. No. That's an interesting angle. Because we went into it thinking it's an IoT project. Right. It's not. What you just said. You're absolutely right. It's a unifying the data project that enables them. This is. This is the proposal. Yeah. This is the proposal. I always wanted to write advervent. But Jim and Aaron Campice would never let me. Because we did not have the data people to do it. Then I would say. Well, I have this background. Jake, we can't build this business on you. And I'm like. Well, Jim, we built this whole business on you. What are you saying? And then he would just like bristle. And it's like, seriously, this is the proposal I've always wanted to write. Because connectivity. You're not wrong. Well, no. But it's like we built. We did. You got to give him credit. There was a period of time where that guy was just rocking and rolling. But he committed. It was built on his capabilities and his thought leadership. Right. And we did. And we came up with how we would sell it. But Jim came up with what we were supporting. And we did. And that's what we're going to do. Right. That's absolutely right. And that's not uncommon. That's how a lot of businesses start. And that's there's nothing wrong with that. Well, there's nothing wrong with that. But the end result is. If you can't go beyond you, you're always limiting your capability. Jim should have Jim should have retired. I mean, what did he get? What did you tell me? What do you get? Ten million out of this whole deal? I think that's what. Yeah. But it should have been 50. You know what I mean? Yeah. And that's I mean. I don't know if anybody's at, because he's got, of course, a beautiful home and he's got a good life, but it's like, you know what probably hurt his ego even more? It's like, here's what you lost out on because you refused to grow other people. And you didn't bring people better than you and put them around you. Sorry. Can you imagine when you came on board and that growth team was taken off, so you'd been there a little bit, and the amount of projects we had at that point, if Jim and Mayor would have just kind of stepped aside and said, all right, guys, we're leaders, but no good leader is smarter than the people doing the work, right? And just stepped aside and allowed you guys to form the direction or the path that we were going to take going forward, we would have crushed it. We would have went from $200 million to $400 million, right? But instead, you know what happened. Right? You know the rest of the story. We didn't evolve. And we couldn't do a project for the life of us, right? What people don't understand is that, a lot of people don't understand or never understood, is that OST was run just like a church, exactly like a church. Committee-based, you know what I mean, which was a leadership team. You know what I mean? That's how churches are run. And one figurehead, which is the pastor or the preacher. It was absolutely... And I don't know about you, Mike, but outside of a very few exceptions, churches were not fast-moving and growing institutions. No. Or evolving institutions. Don't get me wrong. There are some really fast-moving churches who decided to be change agents and create more entertainment and actually allow you to bring a Starbucks into the ceremony, which I think is a no-brainer. I think there should be booze, too. That's just my opinion. But that's... Is there a bar here? But why would you not, which for the ones that are doing it, good on you. Why can I not grab a coffee and a flippin' Danish, or here's my gluten-free flippin' muffin that tastes like charcoal, and go sit in the pew and enjoy myself, right? And enjoy the ceremony? Why can't we do that? At my church, you can grab coffee. You can bring it in. Not a lot of people do. But then there's this other one out here. You ever heard of Eagle Brook? I think they're all over the place. Yeah. We have some friends going there. So Jen's like, let's watch just last weekend when we're having coffee. Let's watch a service, right, and just see what it's all about. And they have a coffee shop. You can grab a coffee, go sit down, do whatever you want to do. Yeah, 100%. But what I didn't like about it is they have one leader of, I don't know how many locations they have. Let's say it's five. The one they built out here is like a mega church, right? And so you watch these sermons on a video. So it's like you're in there. They all have their own band. But the sermon and the message, it's all on a screen. I'm like, I don't want that. I don't want that. Like, that's not what I want. I'm not saying it's wrong by any means. But if I'm going to go, it's part of your community, right, and stuff. But I'm with you 100%. The only reason I brought that up. Yeah. They have a coffee shop inside their new church over here or worship place. I don't know if they call it a church. But yeah, coffee shop and all kinds of other stuff. I'm like, that's brilliant. I think the bar idea is great. You go to Saturday night class or Sunday night. You should. 100%. Yes. Yeah, I'll take a Bloody Mary and a Shana. Yes. 100%. It is just there are. And make your classes interesting. You know what I mean? Make your classes interesting. And it's like, anyway, it's just there is such an opportunity for people to feel that spiritual side that we all have. I think my view, it's been better than humanity, right? It's just people try to fill it with everything else. Well, and people try to fill it with everything else. And they realize, yeah, you can't. There's only one way to fill it. And stuff doesn't bring you happiness, right? And it doesn't. Or whatever else. No. No. Well, when you're purposeless and you don't understand why you're here, yeah, that's a tough way to live. And you're not going to find it on YouTube. You sure as hell aren't going to find it in daytime TV. Sure as hell aren't going to, you know what I mean, find it in booze and drugs. Everyone's trying to find a way to fill it. And there's just no path. But it's like at the same time, though, we can acknowledge whether we agree or disagree with them. There's an entertainment part of our culture. And some churches have embraced that. Great. You have a band. Good start. But you know what? If I'm going to sit and listen to you and I'm going to sit and give you my money, I want to grow. I want to grow spiritually. I want to be mentored. I want to be coached. But you know what? I can have a freaking cup of coffee and listen to you drone on about stuff. Yeah. I just want. And if there's little Bailey's in there, more power to it. You might even get more money. You know what? I didn't think about that. I love that sermon here. Why can't we go to December 18th? I don't even know what December 18th is, but just go with me on this. Why can't we go to December 18th church? And someone's like, man, the eggnog's rocking this morning. Woo. Like, you know what? No, I'm not talking about a party. But it's like, you know what? And if that's a sin, well, you know what? But it's also, I'm sorry, churches are a business. And there's like, but you know what? What are we here for? We're not asking people to take Ubers home. However, that is a possibility. You know what I mean? You know what I mean? But it's just, I'm joking. But it's like. How funny would that be? You drive by a church. Just out of control. It's Sunday night and there's like 50 cars still in the parking lot. What are all those cars doing? All those guys that took Ubers home. And you just, you hear the, you hear the music going. It's like. It's like. It's like. It's like. It's like. Right? And it's like. Five hour sermon. The bars are pissed. What's going on down at St. Michael's, man? It's like out of control. Everybody's going. It's like. Dude, that's hilarious. Oh my God. But you know what? If I'm a pastor and I go up to the pearly gates, it's like, hey, I got people in church, right? You can, I'll stay, I'll stay in purgatory for this one. I got people in church, right? I would say. Hey, God, what do you mean you're not going to let me in? Jesus was taking water and making endless wine out of it. You know, and I'm the problem? Yeah, right? Jesus liked wine so much, he was just grabbing water out of the wine. There's a, there's a branding idea in there somewhere for a church. Water to wine, Saturday nights at seven o'clock. Oh my God. Drugs are welcome. Drugs. Well, hey, come here, get some church in, but you know, hey, if you have a problem, this isn't for you. Let's, here's another, here's another stand for you, right? We don't want you to have a problem. This is just, you know, just basic harmless enjoyment here, but no one's going to. Your AA class is right after the sermon. God. All right. Now those that want to stay for AA. Hey, and you can't discriminate. There needs to be a smoke shop in there for those. Those that participate in the marijuana, right? And you know what? You don't want the smell, so you'd have to have gummies. Have a gummy. And I don't know about you, but in my traditions, I guess, in my friend group and churches, I've yet to ever go to a funeral where the, especially the family impact involved, did not go to a bar afterwards. And I don't know if that's just common to me or if that's just, you know, whatever, but I mean, it's typically common. And why in the world would a church not go to a bar? I mean, I'm not saying that. Meaning, I'm just saying it's like, we know where you're going. And it's like, you know what? We're human. And you know what? Sometimes that stiff Manhattan is just the right thing. I'll tell you, when my father died, there was five of them. Oh my gosh. I'll be the same way. And it was, there was five of them. And it was like, and you know what? I'll be honest. I'm not a, I'm not a, I do not drink often, but I'm telling you what? It helped a little bit. If that's wrong, so be it. But you know what? I was not in a, I was not in a good mood. And, uh, and you know what though? But it's like, what a different way of a different experience. It's like, no, you're not going to do it in the main, you know, worship area. You're going to go off to another part of the church. But it's like, you know what? Folks, relax, kick back. Let's share some stories. Here's the lunch. And it's like, and if you want to partake, if you want a little snort, here you go. Yeah. Right. I love it. Well, and you know what? That's, that actually is a good business model. Cause a lot of churches are now missing out on the full service. Cause a lot of people are doing the celebration of life at a restaurant or a bar. Right. There is no more, you know, I mean, you and I were just talking about this, don't we? That I think the last, um, well, I know the last probably four or five now COVID had something to do with this too, but they're all celebrations of life. They're there. I didn't go to a funeral. I did for my aunts and my uncle, but the other ones, Jen's uncle, they didn't have a funeral. They just had a, they rented out a room at the Boulevard in Minnetonka, the restaurant, and they just had videos run in and some of his pictures up like you'd normally do at a funeral. And everybody's there to drink and have a good time and talk about memories. One quick second here. Yeah. Don't. You're right. Church is missing out on that. They're just, and I get it. I know. I know. I know the majority would disagree with me, but I'm just saying churches need funding sources. And it's like, um, one, yeah, I hear we're, we're focusing on bad behaviors, but at the same time, um, they need the funding sources. Yeah. Yeah. So what'd you think of, uh, Ipsos? One quick second here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. all right all right all right all right sorry about that no there's a no worries sorry i have my apologies again about my camera um there's a part of um that is uh i know we can go after every segment but here's an example honestly we could go after other consult professional services firms who have no idea how to do any of this shit you know what i mean we literally could as clients law firms you know we talked about the legal uh capabilities not just being a managed services provider but also innovator you know in terms of it's like you guys can release co-pilot that's as far as you've gone you're missing out you know what i mean here's reality did i how did i do by the way do you think that stuff resonated with her or yeah i think you did really good i was watching her and you know knowing she's a ux person you hit all the right terms right and talk track yeah um and ux people are thinkers right so you were you were giving her a lot of information i saw her writing down a lot and that's why i offered to do a video um sorry to put that on your plate no no worries but happy to do it i'm like she wrote it down but is she going to be able to articulate it sure if she needs to talk to other people now she's pretty smart she's a really smart person smart and this is your friend's wife sorry yeah so weird situation so a good buddy of mine yeah was married to this gal and had three kids and they lived in new hope so right down the road i'm actually godparent to one of his kids and uh actually genuinely for godparents his middle child and he one day just decided to leave and he moved down to arkansas worked for walmart and devastated his family right and um you know there's obviously two sides to the story but he just kind of disappeared and i don't know what happened and you know i don't want to pry too much but we felt absolutely terrible for care of his kids yeah which we continue to see in sports because we played armstrong a lot armstrong cooper yeah um they're in their district so she you know over time she got over it she remarried she's doing really good mark met yana who i haven't met but i've seen her in pictures right yeah um and they do a lot together so and mark is one of the kindest nicest guys you'd ever meet so it's really weird that this happened and i think what happened is he he's a designer and he lost his job and was having a really hard time finding a job and him and his wife were having issues and he was like i don't know he has issues and she was she was pretty strong-willed person not not saying she deserved this right by any means nobody does but he he found a job worked for walmart so he took that job um and he had to move down there so he was coming back every couple of weeks for what he could afford and then he just stopped coming back so there's more to the story i don't want to paint him as a bad person because um you know he might not be but i wasn't too happy about that so i left don't have it yeah but uh yeah i mean so he met her anyways and they've been dating now for a while and now it sounds like he moved out to new york three years ago and they live together she looked like she had a ring so i'm guessing they're married okay but i'm when i'm reaching out to him i just started the email and i'll finish it but i'll have a call with him today thanking him but she's uh either way she's just absolutely brilliant i mean hearing what she was saying and talking about it's like oh yeah she knows her stuff and there's a little bit of fear i think in her with uh am i gonna have a job where's it all going well you it's how can i help my people right well that's the like i'm like i'm curious like like what's gartner gonna look like these big research institutions and it's like i swear to god i view their value proposition it's like ai is going to be out but ai didn't talk to people we did you know what i mean and it's like or the combination of the two i just view these as much more um smaller efficient institutions but their expertise is kind of what i described and again everything goes back to that intelligence layer that's their that if they got that right they could be like we can dust our competition here's what makes us special because that's going to be the true competitive thing in that space my models are better than theirs if they're both using the same models or we both use google mike what's the difference what's your value you know what i mean yeah well we asked we asked better questions than they do okay whatever or you could say no we use our own models for analysis and we write our own models and that's why we get better outcomes than our competitors who are just using lm shit but that's you know what i mean and maybe that needs to be in the video um that you do is you know how you know you do such a good job with this but you kind of lay it out for what she's looking for in her department and then you say how you get there is this and draw and then you paint that unified uh data uh unified data um example that you just had right unifying the data is what i was trying to say there the holy grail yeah that'd be a great message for other people to see the holy grail in their world is the blending of qualitative and quantitative data sets and getting to correlation and attribution it's really really hard and no doubt i mean ai is helping them do that better before however what they're not seeing is that and the results are somewhat probably inconsistent at best and you're spending all your time fashioning prompts and doing all these other things to fashion it the way you want that's great or would you rather just have a machine learning model that just nails it on the first run yeah just saying yes just saying um that and you mentioned this at the beginning and i absolutely agree the information that they've collected in their you know i don't know 60 years of business or however long they've been around think of the information the data they have bingo it's like they shit ton of data shit ton they could create a system second to none you know what i mean just rock star stuff i mean you want to pull up any of the data that you have and you're like oh my god i'm not going to past reports you've done past industry analysis you want to draw out where things were and where they're going over the last hundred years they have so much data there and those are just some quick ones off the top of my head it's endless the amount of stuff that they can do with that data ah that would be an understatement worth a lot of money um um there's different yeah there's lots of different ways they could potentially monetize it um they'd have to anonymize all of it because all their agreements say we're not we'll never make your stuff public but that would be the the the thing if you will um one second here i am in the process um i'll show you here in one second oh come on you you you you you i swear to god teams is like impacting my whole system i can't explain it man you don't have like a virus day or something no i just got pinged from one of the professors earlier this morning they got nailed with scareware which is a big malware thing that's been out there for years and she's like yeah i clicked on all these sayings and it's like just shut off your computer you're not going to be able to do anything about it you're not going to be able to do anything about it and go bring it to IT. Well, can't you help me? I said no. Don't do anything with it. Shut it off. Bring it to IT. It could have key loggers. It could have everything. You got nailed with malware. Just accept it. Take it for what it is. Do you really think that the guys in IT at the university will know what to do? I said no. But I said still, you got to bring it to them. I love it. They'll have no clue, but they'll wipe it. Alright, so... Whoops, let me pull this up for you here. I am just doing the final read on the business plans. It's essentially done. I'm just being ultra anal. Thank you for getting that done, though. That's huge to get that offer played. Yeah, here... Actually, I'll show it to you in code form. Because everything's in code first. Will I even be able to share my screen?
