## 📄 TRANSCRIPT

I have, I don't know, I have like the job of my dreams. Yeah, you love to travel a lot? I do. Okay. Well, I mean, we use Teams primarily, let's just say, but I do get to travel generally. The first six months of the year are our big travel time for me because I go out and I, you know, help everybody launch the year with training and new product offers and biz dev help because my job is basically to upskill everyone and make sure our, you know, delivery is consistent and innovate on new products, which is why. Thank you. What he's seeing is intersecting with what I'm seeing. Sure. No, that's a great idea. And being young and connected, I mean, I've been in the industry for 50 years and we started this company for that same fact that, and I'll tell you a little more history about us when we get going, but it's so hard to keep up. Absolutely right. Unless you're structured for the AI quantum era. Right. It's really, really hard to do all the traditional. Things that you're used to doing. Yep. And try to get up to speed with what's going on with AI and then what's working and what's not. Right. Right. I'm sure every partner you have, they come in and they have their own ideas and they want to own their data. Right. And you're like, which way do I go? What do I do? Yeah. Yeah. So. Yeah. We've specifically been looking at agentic solutions recently, you know, and did a huge RFI and then an RFP. And, you know, I have a sense of where I think we should be going. Because I use the tools, you know. Sure. And for me, it's about, you know, finding tools that my team can use off the shelf the way they've used every last tool. Right. We just can't make this stuff so complex. You know, when we first we we do have an internal AI system that. It's in a nice Below to the side. Yeah. So what we did is we placed in three separate gray areas. Right. And you just have create the process.
