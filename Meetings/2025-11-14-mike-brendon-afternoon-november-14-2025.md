# MEETING — 2025-11-14-mike-brendon-afternoon-november-14-2025 — 2025-11-15

## ATTENDEES
- David Ellison (CEO, Skydance Media)
- Larry Ellison (Founder, Oracle)
- Paradisio (Affiliation not specified, likely partner contact)
- Andrew (Representative, Global Foundries)
- Martin (Affiliation not specified, possibly internal team member)
- Jake (Internal participant)

- Crowley (Affiliation not specified, possibly internal team member)
- Unnamed meeting participants (internal team discussing Oracle and Arrow partnership opportunities)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The meeting focused on two main threads: first, clarifying Oracle’s relationship with Arrow and potential opportunities to position the team as an Oracle integrator or implementer; second, following up on a prior discussion with Andrew from Global Foundries regarding FedRAMP and CMMC compliance support. The participants explored how to create compelling video content to pitch their capabilities to both Oracle-related contacts and Global Foundries.

The Oracle discussion revolved around understanding Arrow’s involvement with Oracle technologies, particularly Oracle Cloud, and determining how to present their services effectively. The team agreed to reach out to David and Paradisio for a comprehensive overview of Arrow’s Oracle capabilities before producing a video pitch. The Global Foundries discussion revisited a previous call about compliance readiness, where the team planned to create a short, targeted video demonstrating their expertise in CMMC and FedRAMP preparation.

Overall, the tone was collaborative but somewhat disorganized, with participants acknowledging gaps in their notes and information. The meeting concluded with clear next steps to gather missing data, prepare follow-up communications, and develop tailored video content for both Oracle and Global Foundries opportunities.

## KEY DECISIONS
1. Decision to contact David and Paradisio to obtain a full overview of Arrow’s Oracle-related capabilities before producing any marketing or proposal video.
2. Agreement to create a short, focused video for Global Foundries highlighting the team’s expertise in CMMC compliance and FedRAMP readiness.
3. Consensus that the Oracle video pitch should only proceed once Arrow’s Oracle service scope is confirmed, to avoid misrepresentation.
4. Decision to follow up with Andrew from Global Foundries to confirm next steps and maintain engagement through a compliance-focused video presentation.

## 📄 TRANSCRIPT

Oracle. Are they related? I don't believe Oracle is done. I think this is a different Ellison because this isn't the Oracle. I'm sorry. Is David Ellison the son? The cousin? That's what I'm starting to look at. Who's David? Yeah, the father-son. So David owns the Skydance Media. He's a film producer. And CEO. So they bought Paramount. Okay. Alright, now it's all coming together. Man, smarty pants. Family, huh? I didn't know that. I have no idea that. So Larry Ellison owns freaking Paramount? Jesus. Yes. Wow. I mean, what doesn't this guy own these days? It's freaking unbelievable, isn't it? So everything's going Oracle. Oracle. I wonder how unique we can be with... We gotta think through a video we can send back that just wows them. Well, we need to find out... I don't know. I kind of bullshitted a little bit, but I don't know how much Arrow does in Oracle. I don't believe it's in the line card, but I don't know that. That's what we need to know. You know what I mean? I think they do a lot... Arrow? I think they do a lot with Oracle. I don't know. I don't... In terms of ERP, like, they don't do SAP. They don't do Infor. They don't do Oracle. I don't see... Now, don't get me wrong. Oracle Cloud? Which is... The point is where... I haven't seen Oracle on any other stuff. It's gotta be in there, but to what extent? I don't know. You know what I mean? Oracle's a massive ecosystem. And I don't know where they are on their line card, but that's the email we send off to David and to Paradisio. Tell us everything you guys can do in Oracle. You know what I mean? I think we just ask them. Give us the whole lay of the land, please. And then we decide on what kind of video that we build from there, and whether we can present ourselves as an Oracle integrator, implementer. You know what I mean? Because that's as far as we're gonna go. In terms of wowing them, it's the data center. I mean, the whole point is if we pursue that avenue in terms of the migrations, that's a whole other... Again, that's a whole other piece, if you will. Yeah, that's... I was just pulling up Paradisio so I could send him a note. It looks like he sent us an email today, too, so I'll respond to that. Okay, so I'll find out... Across the biggest thing we could offer them is we can assemble... the multitude of teams it would take to migrate all of these applications into the Oracle universe. That would be the pitch, in my mind. Okay. But the question is, where? You know what I mean? What do you guys do? You're not an Oracle implementer, but what do you do on the services side with Oracle? Precisely. You know what I mean? You know what I mean? If it's like ServiceNow, if it's like the other ones, yeah, we support NetSuite, we support... or we just support Oracle DP or we support Oracle Cloud. Okay, great. Now the pitch is... that's the speed thing. Independent teams that work with independent applications to do the migrations to get into Oracle Cloud. That would be the pitch. Okay, so let me talk to them and see what we can do. We'll get a meeting. I'll see if you can get us a meeting. Because I feel like if they send us a message, we're going to be like, oh, we're going to get this shit. And then we talk to somebody. It's like, oh, we do these things. It's like that wasn't in your documentation. You sent me. Even like Martin, he throws up their vendors on the thing. I'm like, they're missing like half of their key vendors on those slides. Half? They're missing like 90 fucking percent. That's a small fucking list. It's like, dude, put it up there. I'm looking. Yeah, I'm looking at the list. I'm like, some of these aren't even important to most of us. Like, everybody does some of those. Like, there's nothing special about it. It's when you look at the line cards, you know, it's like, oh, I'm going to put this on the card. I mean, it's just it's ridiculous. It's just like, dude, you got to be kidding me. So. When I get really tough to put up on a screen, but yeah, it is just give us the entire lay of the land. What are you doing? What do you do in that space? And then we could then we can assemble it and do the video. Other than that, right now, the video would be hope and a prayer that Oracle that I saw that arrow can do it, but that's what it would be. OK, all right. That's fair enough. I'll work on that. I'll get that. I'll get that figured out. The next question I got for you is the call that we had with Andrew earlier this week from foundries. How do we want to I got to respond back to him with some information. I think it's on this note card. We got to get back to him. Was it on FedRAMP that he wanted? No, it was on a note to Andrew. I told him we do a video. Remind me the name of their company again real quick. I got to look at that was foundry something. Give me a second. Sorry. No, we're global boundaries. Here's when we talked to on Wednesday. Yeah, the semiconductor manufacturer. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Andrew was his name. And we're there to talk about FedRAMP member. Yeah. And I'm trying. I just have a couple of notes. Yeah, I'm just I was unable to know. I was unable to record it. Yeah. I know. And I don't have the best notes. So he wanted us to get back to him with the video of. God, how do I not have better notes than this? The fuck? I pretty much have it right. He is a low level. If I remember right, he is. He is basically defender. If I remember right, right. He was the general just around governance. Right. No, he wouldn't be going there and possibly like you know, like raising a hand media blame And he just didn't appreciate the fool. But he just kept raising his hand him because maybe you wanted to read with you how his But this is why you upgraded the system, because you are not letting the application switch Yep. through that talk track so we talked about fed ramp what that means for them they had they have initiatives going on that he said hasn't really started or taken place um fuck jake i can't i can't i took really shitty scribbly notes here and so what i offered was now it's coming back now it's coming back to me what i offered was their cmmc compliance audit is coming up and i asked them basically are you prepared yes that's what i thank you so that's what it was are you prepared we can help prepare you thank you oh for the love of goodness sakes so so we i think what we can do oh keep going i'm sorry keep going the video would be around all of that which is we would come in and do a rapid assessment like i said with the arrow team where are you at with everything here's your remediation task before your audit you don't want to wait to your audit that's not what you want no you gotta be prepared you gotta be i mean your that reflects on your that all goes back to the dod you don't want that so and then the whole point was again that was what it was and then the whole point was around the invitation of a next call we'll do this video you bring more people and we can walk you through all of that right and i'll thank you and i'll talk about the nist families and all these other things and cmmc compliance and like this would be the reason to talk to us right we make sure you're ready and everything else like that i think that's perfect okay thank you for remembering that i wouldn't that was so far out of my brain and i took the shittiest notes they got data centers in new york and burlington i was also rushed too because i was preparing to go out and get ready to walk on stage and it just you know i'm sitting there and i'm fumbling things and i'm opening a lobby and yeah it wasn't the ideal but i know normally no and then he said they don't have azure governed government or governed cloud hasn't happened but it was supposed to they need consulting help and that was all i had and then i had a bit send him a video and that's all i wrote i'm like what the i'm so used to having you have everything recorded i took really shitty notes so no that's totally it so do you think we do a video do we do a video kind of like what you did for oshkosh but a lot smaller where it shows you understand the fed ramp and the requirements and then you talk and then you jump into um cmc and how you need to prep for it it's not even fed ramp i still don't get the applicability of fedramp but it doesn't oh so you don't even see how it ties it okay i know you asked those questions on the call and you couldn't really answer that what's that i know you asked those questions on the call but Paul, he couldn't really answer the question. It's similar to Oshkosh in terms of, well, because now Oshkosh was much, much more structured because they're trying to figure out what can I get away with because GovCloud's not cheap, man. It's not cheap. Oh, I can't imagine. And it's like everything goes up by a factor of X, right, for a whole host of reasons. And, you know, it's the government's specific requirements. You know what I mean? And there's a cost to that. So the other part of that is, in this case, it is literally just showcasing our expertise across infrastructure, networking. It's literally the broader pitch and how we can help you prepare for CMMC compliance. If your audit is coming, you've got to be ready. Now, don't get me wrong. I have a feeling they're already a government contractor. They probably have a lot of their stuff together. But I will highlight to them. And here's typically where we see groups like yours fail. Here are the six families that always get you. They always do. You're weak on your governance. You're weak on your monitoring. You're weak on, you know what I mean? It's all these things. And it's like if you want to sail through on that, here's the reason to contact us. Something along those lines. Okay. Yeah, that sounds great. That. I did not know that world. So I will take your recommendations on that. Okay. Yeah. All right. That's all I can think of. And then, yeah, we'll have to get back to Ipsos to do this video. Crowley wasn't getting my emails, so I hope he got them now with the video. Oh, they shut off his verban? They shut off his verban stuff or be talking about privately? He had me send it to his, his, um, calm for an email, but it wasn't going through it. I'm like, I'm probably in your spam, but he couldn't find it. So then I sent it to, on Wednesday I sent it to his personal. Um, he wants to get it up to those guys ASAP. So yeah, I'm like, that's weird. I don't know why I've sent it twice now. Do. It was. Okay. Comfort. so I don't know if it got flagged. Maybe Garrity has anything flagged coming from us and Vervent. I wouldn't put it past them. Flag it all. Don't let it go to Jim. It's got to be something to do with our .ai. We've got to be in a spam filter somewhere, I would think. I don't know. It's not the first time it's happened, right? But thanks for doing that video. That video was really good. Yeah, no worries, man. I'm going to dump our webinar on Tuesday and reschedule it. We only have Ron and then my buddy from Best Buy. I'm going to go see him on Thursday. Ron from Oshkosh will reschedule. Maybe we'll do a one-on-one. We're just... The timing... I'm getting feedback that it's shitty timing. I'm like, what? Everybody's trying to get... This is my fault. Everybody's trying to get their shit done because they're off the next week. I'm like, well, it's over at lunch. And they're like, yeah, but I just don't have the time. Thinking early. What are you thinking? Sometime in December? Or what are you thinking? I'm thinking either... I asked this question. What about mid-December? They're like, same thing. And I'm like, well... Yeah, that's true. Won't you be done with everything? And then you kind of float. And they're like, no, because we want it all off our plate for year-end stuff. And then we're done from Christmas until New Year's. So I'm thinking to dump it until mid-January. Are you okay with that? I think so. I mean, we've got to do it, right? If we only have that many. The point being, I've got some ideas to talk about as we're kind of going up through then. But it's like, I kind of got that after talking with people at the conference. It's like, it reminds me of 2022. Sorry, 2021. Prime COVID. Remember, my impression at that time was... How do you want to say it? My impression at that time was... I heard more people talk about as of January 5th, I'm fucking done. Like, I'm fucking done. I feel like I'm hearing that again. Just talking with people, they're like, fuck, can't wait for the holidays. What's the holidays? I can't wait for December 10th, and I'm fucking done. The rest of the year, I'm like, what the fuck? You know what I mean? I'm just hearing that again, and it's like, people are spent. People don't know if they're even going to have jobs. People are just like... It's a really weird time. Fucking done, man. No, I agree. I think, kick it to the next year, see who the fuck has left. You know what I mean? And who has a job? I'm almost thinking late January. Give everybody time to get back. Get back in, re-look at all their budgets and projects. They get re-confirmation of what's going to get pushed through, what's not, what are the hot topics. Yeah, it sucks. I email a lot of people and called a lot of people, but the common... Well, I did get a couple, what the hell is vibe coding? But that was an easy one to talk through. But the rest was, dude, I'm swamped. I got no time for nothing, let alone to look at new things. So, not going to happen. I'm not sure. So, we'll get it next year. Okay. So, I hate canceling stuff, but in this case, I'll have Shane talk to Ron and just say, hey, I'll say I had to move it because a lot of people's calendars are not looking good and they've asked to push it till late January. Okay. Cool. And we got immediately out scheduled at that time, so it works out perfect. No worries. All right, I'm going to do that. I'm going to reach out to Paradisio and then I'm going to grab some lunch. Did you want to meet this afternoon or did you want a break? I know you're super wore out. I'm okay just working. So, whatever you want to do. I'm going to do the same. I'm going to go grab a quick bite to eat, do some jazz and know if we need to touch base, but no, I'm fine. I don't know what you have planned or what's going on. I'm just going to be head down. If we don't need to meet, let's not meet. Let's just keep working. So, up to you. Next week, should we talk about, you know, we're sitting in all these meetings, you know, whether it's the Arrow stuff that we just went to, things that I'm reading online and you're reading online, conversations you had with Lisa. Do you think we maybe spend like two or three months really narrowly focused? A couple of verticals, a couple of offerings and just hit them hard? What are your thoughts? Because I'm certain that, you know, some of the people that are making a lot of money that I've met, right, at the Arrow event or I already knew from the event before, they're hyper-focused. That's also why they're dying. And I don't like hyper-focused. That's why they're dying now. That was the other common thread. A lot of them are declining. Yeah. But I'm wondering, do we, not for that reason, but do we hyper-focus for a few months? If we feel like we got a really kick-ass offering and something and we just turn up the dial a little bit on trying to get meetings. What are your thoughts? Hyper-focus in this era means who are we talking to? And that's the stuff I want to finish this weekend. I didn't finish it before we left. But I have this whole suite of things coming to you, which is now our ecosystem. Yep. The finalization of our vendors. We're not, we're not going to talk about the holistic picture with everyone we're talking to. It all depends on their role. If it's a CTO, sure, here's our entire ecosystem. If it's a CIO, sure, here's our entire ecosystem. But I mean, if we're talking to the head of analytics, we're talking about our data ecosystem. If we're talking to a head of infrastructure, here's our infrastructure ecosystem. We're talking to a cybersecurity, which is, that's one that has to be a focus. I sent you an article this morning on, fuck. I saw that. I haven't read it yet, but thank you. Fuck me. The guy at the Lambo, that's all he does is cybersecurity. It's a, again, again, looking at all these things like socks, but our hyper-focused, I mean, don't get me wrong. When we look at a company, it's what are the roles? And that's where we hyper, we hyper-focus by role. Now, if we only want to talk to cybersecurity people, I mean, that's where the focus would be. But don't get me wrong. I also believe that when we look at an institution, we're not just talking to cybersecurity people. We're talking to broader roles across an institution. And that's the part where the pitch changes. Our pitch just adjusts depending on who we're talking to. I was thinking more verticalized, like Mark, like the Mark, like Lisa's company. You know, you talked about legal before. Like, do we do some sprints where we focus in an area and see what sticks? Not, not a persona, but, but more of the vertical, like, you know, legal marketing or PR, I guess is a better way to put that. Right. Let me finish what I'm working on. Then, then make up your mind. Then, then see what you think. Okay. Because I'm just, I want some quick wins. Like, how do we get some quick wins going? And we just start piling those things up. Right. We got a lot of good stuff in the works, but we need some quick wins to start building some momentum. You always had it right. If we, if to get the quick wins, build momentum, we need to target smaller companies so we can talk to get more exposure to leaders where we have, you know what I mean? Enterprise is going to be the enterprise and that just takes time. Cloudera. Um, I think that motion continues. I think it'll, it's just going to pay off later on. Cause it's just some, the way the market is moving, Cloudera was solved some very specific problems that are coming. Thank you. They're just, um, they're going to solve some very specific problems, um, that I'm really eager and waiting for. Cybersecurity is the big one. The, the anthropic thing that I sent you this morning is exactly what I was waiting for. China took over anthropic without their knowledge and use their own AI against them to develop state-of-the-art tools that targeted unnamed, uh, I can already imagine who they are. 30 of our top companies. No nation state attack. It's, I don't know why this is not on the front, but right now Epstein's on the front page of everything, but it's like this kind of flew under the radar. I didn't miss it. Our bots caught it. I'm like, what the fuck? I knew it was a matter of time. That's brazen shit. And they actually thought they could get away with it. This is what they probably sit in there. While they're doing it lap and like, how come somebody hasn't stopped this yet? And they're just going, it's, um, don't get me wrong. Rumor has it. We've already done it to them. And was this in retaliation? Cause of course you never hear, you never hear about what we do to them. And unless, you know, they don't want us to ever have the publicity, but that's just a rumor. I don't know if it's true. I've, I've seen the, in those circles of like, cause United States, does these little things. And it's been clear. Trump has been needling some of these companies, especially Russia. The other part of that though, as two is also like motherfuckers don't fuck around a little bit, but China is also flexing to, of saying to can play at this game. I have, I have a lot more questions. There's a lot, of course, there's a ton that has been disclosed, but good, good on the CEO. And he handled it right. This, this is from the CEO of Anthropic. This isn't just a media rumor. This guy, this happened. Here's what we did to fix remediated or whatever. Well, they caught it in the middle of the attack. They knew something was going on and it was like, here's what's going on. We know it's China. And it's like, here's what we did about it. We're working with the people. The companies have not been disclosed, but it's just, it's like, this gets back to my point. Are you going to use big ass third party services? My bet is, you're not, you're going to want to build this shit on-prem yourself. Then that's where you and I don't care which direction it goes. Either way we win. But that one is the big one. Everybody wants their own private models because you can't, how the hell do you deal with this shit? You know what I mean? Crazy though. Open AI is not going to rule the world as much as they want to. The fragmented nature of it is going to be our strength. You want to mean, and I'm sorry, JP Morgan isn't sharing with fucking anyone. Neither is Goldman Sachs. Sorry. Neither will 3M. Neither will Dow. Are you kidding me? Really? Yeah, man, let's all use, you know, fuck that shit. They're going to be like, um, we have our own plans, our own data centers, our own compute. We've got our own little world that we're going to worry about. We'll, we'll use your stuff for little things. That's fine. But you know what I mean? That's I, cause, and this is the threat. Oh, you're big and all powerful. China, Russia are going to fuck with you. That means they're fucking with us. And so we're not interested. Anyway, just my belief, but it's a, um, but I mean, the bigger to answer your question, as we get down to the targets on things like that, should we always be talking to the Cyrus cybersecurity people in every single pit? Yeah, always. I think we should constantly. That's always a pitch we want to do. Um, but it's our pitch for every single function and role and how you, where you are at in our ecosystem that we can help you. So take a look at what I'm going to send you. I love, yeah, I love that idea. And then referencing these attacks, right? I think that's a great idea. So we can't cyber security. Is this going to be a train? And of course they announced as I'm still, I'm still confused because I didn't think that they had a sock as a service. Now they announced a sock as a service. So which is it? You guys say you support Arctic wolves or are you using Arctic wolf? Or you guys just have your own. Cause if you guys have sock as a service, fucking great. We'll sell that shit all day long. Are you kidding me? That's just easy. That's a license to steal. Um, that, that would be the big one. It's like, um, sock ML ops. You know what I mean? These inference or, you know, those kind of, I'll anyway, I'll paint this whole thing for you as my point. And you tell me in terms of, I think it's like when you say in terms of hyper focus, I would say we are, but it just depends on, I mean, it also, it also depends on which who's taking meetings right now too. You know what I mean? Where I think, so we can say we're hyper focused, but if those people aren't taking meetings, that doesn't mean very much. I mean, so I love having those options as to, well, who's, who's taking meetings right now and who's focused on our, as our message is resonating. Don't get me wrong to your point. We get hot. You know, do I believe the intelligence layer is big for every single fucking agency? Yeah. And do I think the, uh, e-discovery thing and law firm and those specific niche things, I agree with you on here's a hyper, here's a, a key thing that solves a lot of your problems. And I had argued the same thing for marketing as a whole. You guys are using 10 different fucking tools. Why? Yeah. Really? Well, we got our social media tools, but I mean, have fun devil, digital swivel chairing. You know what I mean? So no, I'm, I'm just like, so probably not the answer you wanted to hear, but I just, I think it depends. It's one thing to hyper focus on one thing. Well, look at cloud era. We're going to be hyper focused on octopi. They didn't make any progress on octopi, so you can be hyper focused and not get anywhere where it's true. Find the pain, find the pain, find what's resonating. We just have to find out which function in the enterprise is, has the most fricking pain. And where are these AI decisions going to be made across? You know what I mean? And we got to validate really quickly. Are you guys done with it for now? Just like you were in the beginning of the SAS era and you guys want to, do you guys want all these solutions you're ready to buy on now? It's a very different conversation. True. You know what I mean? Yep. What if there's, here we go. I was just trying to figure out, you know, is there something we can do to really streamline? And, and hit, hit, you know, maybe it's a vertical or whatever, hit it hard. If there's like something tangible there that we think we could move the needle quickly, right. And get some deals. I just, this is the stuff I think about when I'm laying in bed at night. I'm thinking that your instinct on the first one, don't get me wrong. I don't want to ban in the enterprise, but if you and I spend more time talking to $500 million companies and billion dollar companies, we're going to get a lot more meetings and a lot more progress. Yeah. It's been slow on a reach out. If it wasn't specific on something with people responding. I just think that, you know what I mean? I just, we come down in terms of size of companies. So let's plan on that for a Monday. We got the, we have our system now. Thank you very much for getting that set up. I got the invite in there and I'll get in there. I didn't get in there before we left. Um, let's get our list together of, let's just start with 500, you know, 500 million to a billion. You want to mean, and yeah, we'll go from there. I think that I think the size of company is going to be, well, you already know the deal. I mean, it's just, it's going to, it's a different conversation. They're more, they're, um, it's just a different conversation, but if we focus more on the mid market, we're going to make more progress. Okay. Hey, I'm glad I agree with, and okay. I'm not focusing on a particular vendor or stack or not vendor, but a vertical or stack. I'm with you on it. Um, I would never do that in the past. I'm just thinking, you know, times are changing and how do we change with, and is there anything we need to do differently? I just think the focus on the enterprise is going to be the enterprise. We know the enterprise is froze right now. I mean, I don't, again, I do not think we abandoned it. I just think it's a different conversation, but, we're going to move faster talking to, you know, billion dollar companies than $80 billion companies. Yeah, I agree. I want the $80 billion companies too. It's just a longer investment tale, if you will, for the money piece. Yup. 500 million to a billion, um, much easier and broader conversation in terms of our value. I still think our across all of our services, those other pieces plus arrow wants to come down to the mid market anyway, as all these companies do. Um, yeah, I think that's, I think that will serve us well, if we're going to attack and change is that we, we hyper focus, that's where we hyper focus. It's a different size of company where we can really spread our wings in terms of our value because of the size and scope and how are in our model. Great. So if you want to start pulling some lists together, but let's put the list in a, sorry, what's our new tool called to new tool called again. I'm trying to write. Okay. Um, doing it by company size, right? 500 million to 999 million, you know, in this kind of region, if you will. Um, Jake, I almost think we, I mean, so look at Lisa's size company, right? I don't want to go that small, but I think we can almost lower the sites to 200 million. I mean, think of a $200 million company that had nobody's talking to because they're under the radar. And if it's the right type of company, right? Um, I mean, we could pull 300 to a million dollar contracts out of them, right? Let's go down to a hundred million. Let's go a hundred million. Like that's a 200 person company. So you get to a hundred million, they might want to move quick. They got the budget. Nobody's talking to them. They have no insight on what's going on except for what they read. They could be perfect or prime for the picking. Okay. Okay. Okay. Larger law firms of that size. Dorsey went well, Dorsey Whitney's almost a billion, but that's, you know what I mean? God, are they that big now? They're huge. I used to work with those guys when I was at OPM. They're huge. In the mid nineties, they were not that big. Clifton, you know, like Clifton, Larson, Allen's in the hundreds of millions. You know what I mean? I'm talking like accounting. I mean, bottom line, you and I have not talked a lot about professional service. It's not even Lisa, it's professional services as a whole. And it's like, we have some unique solutions. That's where data IQ, that's where I see the play. Yeah. We want bots. What they're never going to build that shit on their own. So here's a platform. Here's how we can start connecting your data sources. Here's how we can start doing these things. You're even looking at inference services where you want to start to train models. You don't have the infrastructure. Bam. There's a clarify. It's these little use cases like that. You know what I mean? Yeah. Or you want to do some certain things where it's like, you're never going to buy, you're never going to spend the, your capital and your, your profit to do all that. I mean, you make 10 million bucks a year. You're not going to wipe out your fucking profit to do all that shit. So here's these little as a service enhancers that you are, that make big monumental leaps for your business. So I'd say let's do a hundred million to 499 million, 500 million to 999 million. And let's start segmenting. But I still say we segment them by industry. Or I don't know, you don't play with a little bit. I saw, I haven't been in there yet. Cause I know we were, you just, you sent it to me and then we were essentially leaving. Um, and I was preparing for that stuff too. So, um, yeah, we can play, I mean, let's play in that space for a few months and get the conversations gone and a little refactoring of our, of our pitch for that in terms of where, I mean, course for managed services and things of that nature. And we'll take a peak, but yeah, we can even the assessments, even the assessments might be perfect. Workshops, workshops and assessments. Not that I want to get back into that shit that we did at OSD, but if it can be ones that were not running arrows running and it drives more opportunities for us, why wouldn't we do it? Yeah. It's a, but yeah, I think we let's segment it that way by $500 million chunks, 100 to 499, 599, 999, then billion to 5 billion, you know, something along the, I don't see a difference between a billion and a 5 billion. They're just, I have, that's always been my experience. I still think, go ahead. We kind of already have the, well, I haven't gotten that low, but, um, I think we, for now, because there's so many companies that fall in that hundred to 499 and five to a billion. I think we've focused there. We might even be able to do more, um, webinars in that. Size companies, because those people will join the webinars, right? They're like, shit, I joined this webinar, learn this stuff. Um, where we're reaching out to these huge companies that have people come see them and they're a little more opposed to the webinars or they don't make them a priority. Yeah. Well, the challenge is, is like the other thing too, as private companies versus public, we're talking to mainly public companies and they're all freaking the fuck out right now. Yeah, they just are. They are. And that could also be too, as like larger private companies where there's more, you know, there's just more security obviously right now versus the public ones because they're dealing with all the fuck, the public scrutiny and stuff. So something like that, you know what I mean? And it's like, no, I'm with you. I just think let's, let's look at these things in segments and we'll play around in the segments a little bit and see what, Hey, we can make in terms of our solutions and offerings and see where we, I still, my gut still tells me that 500 million to 3 billion is the right spot. Let's, let's find out. I know we've been mainly talking to bigger ones and that's a messed up space right now. Let it shake out. And we, we'll give it a try. Right. And we may find that the smaller companies are just too much work for us because sometimes they suck a lot of attention for not for the effort. It's also collection. That's the other issue. It just is. And bad, you're our bad debt, smaller, the company is a larger, our bar, our bad debt expense. That's just going to be a reality. Yeah. That's what sucks about it. These people. Well, it's also a mixture, right? Of things. And it's a, that's, what's nice about having a diverse portfolio among them. You got some big ends, you got some, you know, you got smalls and mediums, you know what I mean? And the small, you know, typically, and I'm not saying the bigger ones are immune, big, big companies make stupid mistakes too, but it's fewer and far between. And smaller entities. Agreed. And we're going to find out that 80, 20 rule anyways, right? That if center of our business is going to come from 20% of the, of our customers, right? But we need that other 80%. Of course the customers, right. The makeup, that other 20, um, I think we start stacking nickels together here at these smaller companies, as we're working to close some of these giants. Yeah. We might find a little honey. I mean, I talked to, so many companies I talked to at arrow there, but nobody works with Vaynerprise. Not one now ahead in worldwide technologies do, but I'm talking to their normal bars. Not in none of them work. I mean, a lot of them do the government, like I told you, which I found very weird, but there are a lot of them work with smaller and small medium. Oh, Oh, Oh, Oh, Jake, I'm hitting that wall that you talked about. I said, I just shut down my, my brain just went a mush. I just, I came home. I didn't have a thing to eat yesterday. Um, I came home and Lisa makes this and I hate it when she does it. Cause they're so fricking good. I just knew I was going to pay for it. She made these cheesy chicken sandwiches, but my wife is a fucking salt fiend and I am not, you know what I mean? Not either. And Jen Jen's a little bit. I don't like a lot of salt. Like I'll sprinkle, you know, I'll just do a sprinkle of salt on things. Then there's Lisa. Like she goes, so, you know, and she's fucking just half the things going on. And I'm the main cook in the family. She doesn't typically do it. And I appreciate it when she does, but I also look at it with a leery eye. Cause typically they're ultra high in salt. And when I have salty foods, I do not sleep well. And I knew I'm like, and I heard cheesy chicken sandwiches are really good. And I'm like, I knew I was going to pay for it. I didn't fucking, I didn't get to bed till I was so tired last night. And I knew I had the sandwiches and I'm like, I just got pissed. I should've just had fricking yogurt and some granola, but I really wanted it pizza fucking stupid. And I'm just, you know what I mean? She uses so much goddamn salt. And then she throws in for a mixture, like, well, I'll throw in a can of, you know, cream of salary in there too, which is like 900 more milligrams per whatever. Oh my God. Anything, anything Campbell soups or shit on a salt. She makes this thing. Her mom made called the hidden chicken and it's really good. Just chicken tenderloins with some Swiss cheese and think of it like a crumb like topping, but the maiden green really hungry cream of fricking chicken soup, man. It's like, can we find a low fucking sodium version of this fucking thing? And it creates like a, a, with the breadcrumbs and it creates like a, not so much like a stuffing, but it creates this dynamic mixture. That's just awesome. But it's so much effing salt, which I'm your wife loves it. I actually loves the salt. See, I found that in, um, new Orleans too. Like I love that jambalaya and like some of those soups. Oh my God, there was salt and I could feel it later on. I'm like a lot of salt content in these babies. I couldn't get my rings off every night. Cause I take them off when I wash up. They go to bed. I couldn't get the shit off. I'm like, how much salt did I just have today? Those grits swollen, those cheddar Bay grits or whatever, which were rotten. Like son of a, I could just, I'm like, I could eat the whole bin. It's so fricking good. I'm like, but there is a lot of salt in here. I could feel it later on. I'm just dousing water. Right. I can just feel it. Yeah. I'm like you, I swolled up like a sausage. I could just feel it. I'm like retaining a little bit of water here. Oh, I think. I'm like, that's not a good sign. Retaining just a little bit of water here. Oh, well, and that beat that they had, um, like the tenderloins and stuff. Holy shit. Those were good. Those were loaded in salt. Yeah. And I ate a lot of those. I was like stacking my plate, but yeah, that, that first night after that SARS Iraq or whatever, fucking, Hey, I was like, my hands are sausages. They're already fat. It's like, I don't, they don't need to be any fatter than this. Dude. I, the food was fan fricking tastic. God damn, man. I told Lisa, I'm like, I don't even want Minnesota food. Now I want to go back to, I want to go back to new Orleans, man. I just, the explosion of flavors and differences. And she's like, she's like, well, I made cheesy chicken sandwiches and I'm like, and back to new Orleans. I'm like, I want to go back to New Orleans. That sounds good though, too. Without the salt. That sounds really good. I sat next to the last night at that venue. I sat next to this gal. She had her, my seat, and that was good for all. They're like, I see. And, we started talking and she's like, who are you? And I'm like, well, we're part of the . Okay. I did it bad. She said, oh, mainly the play. And I said, what's the difference? She goes, I'm the VP of marketing. Dude, you're cutting out really bad for some reason. I am? I am? Yeah, you're cutting out really bad. Yeah, you're fine. Weird. Microphone right here. Okay, it's just sitting right here. So this gal, I was talking to her, and she told me she knew of us, and she was the VP of marketing. So I said, oh, all these events I've been to are phenomenal. So we're talking. So she's got corporate marketing. So she's involved in all the events. But then you've got the other group as, like, the event marketing, but they work together on everything. And she's like, give me a call as you guys get going. Happy to help anywhere you guys want from a marketing perspective. So she's the VP. Corporate marketer. Great gal. I got her name here somewhere on my desk. But she was a really cool person to chat with. She's like, anything you would change about the event? I said, not a thing. I love it. You guys did an amazing job. And then Nathan, I introduced him to her because he's sitting to my right. And she's like, anything you would change? And he's like, yeah, the music. It's too loud. And she goes, what do you mean? And he goes, it's really hard to have conversations because the music, the music was so loud everywhere. It was always blaring. And she goes, yeah, we've had a few complaints. She goes, last year we didn't have any music. So now this year we like, you know, since we're in New Orleans, we want the opposite. There's music everywhere. And I'm like, I'm a music lover. So keep the music. But I said, I agree with Nathan. There are certain venues where it was so loud, it's really hard to have a conversation. But you're also talking to an old guy here who can't hear anymore. So. But. That was his feedback to her. And I just told her, man, we're so impressed with these events. They're the way you guys first class. Oh my God. It's it's I've been to a million of these things with HPE, Dell, VMware, you know, we've been going to these events are forever. Right. And I'm like, this is by far the best partner event I've ever been to. I would agree. I've been to so many, I've spoken at so many and whatever. I mean, first class. I mean, I love the. Don't get me wrong. I thought the Denver one was really good too last year. This was I don't know how to describe it. I don't know if it was like the it just was more, it was cozier. I don't know how to say it. Does that make any sense? Nathan Jones I said quaint. I go, it's really quaint. Like it's a big event, but it's quaint enough where you see the same people every day. You see all the executives from arrow you. It's easy to find the vendors that you want to talk to. Oh, I did. give her feedback. I said, the only thing I'd like to see different is in your app, which I love, I wish there was a way that I could sign up for some of your breakout sessions, because you had a lot of breakout sessions that were in various areas. And unless I had one in particular I really wanted to see, I said, I missed them all. And I would have loved to have been able to put them in my calendar so that I could be like, oh, at this time, I got to go here and this time there. I said, if you could do that, that would be amazing. But otherwise, it was great. There's a few that I wanted to see it until I forgot about them. Yeah, because they were there between noon and three, and they're in other rooms. And unless you're like hounding your app, you're like, I don't know what's going on. The marketers also asked me like, hey, would you be willing to do more of these videos and stuff ongoing? I said, always, I love doing this stuff. I said, so I said, we I said, in addition to that, I mean, any more? I said, I can already think of the 90 ways you could help us. They go, yeah, we'd love to. I mean, if that's she, she, they basically just thought what was the I'm forgetting her fucking name? Yeah, the blonde. Hillary. Yeah, she's amazing. She's really cool. And it's just like, like, I, you know, let's talk and just like, let's talk about the 900 ways we can help each other. If you guys need more partner, I mean, you can, always count me in. You want to flex my title, you want to, I don't care what you're doing, please do. And it's just like, we just need, you know, and more of you guys thinking about how you guys can help us. Or if you guys want to try ideas, different minds that I don't care. I said, let's talk about it. So maybe we do a follow up meeting with her. We just kind of talked about it. We didn't say anything definitively, because it was just bam, bam, bam. And they were so busy. They were off to six other things. But it was just like, I said, you know, if we can create that partnership there, and we can piggyback off of shit they're doing for our own stuff. Great. If we can do that. So I think if we just follow up with her and be like, hey, we just want to follow up post conference. You know, just again, extend our willingness. If we can do anything to help you guys, please let us know. Second, for us, if you think there's anything of value to us based on things you're doing, think you things would be effective in campaigns or other because you guys got so much shit going on, we can't keep up with it. You know, something along those lines just kind of developed that, you know, you'd already done a good job. You already knew a lot of those people from California. Let's just keep up every night. It's awesome. Good people. Let's just keep up the relationship and and buddy like, hey, you know, I mean, we're a small company. And it's like anything you guys think that could help us or even things you should want to experiment with people like us, whatever. You know what I mean? Love to hear it. We might not do everything, but would love to hear it. It could be awesome. I love that idea. I'm going to give a minute to just kind of This. plaque So female executive lady on the panel, the one that was sitting in the middle, the one with the makeup and the eyes. The one on your panel? No, no, no, no, no. The female, all-female panel with the one dude. Okay. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. The one with the skinnier, yeah. I know it's the one that talked a lot. Yeah. She's the CMO of Cisco or something. Is that what it was? Yeah, yeah. No, not Cisco. Was it Cisco? Was it Cisco? It doesn't matter. Anyway. I had the most fucked up dream of her lecturing me on, so I'm going to teach you all about power. So I just, and I just, I was like, I woke up. I'm like, what the fuck? So I am all powerful and you are not. I'm like, where the fuck is my brain going with this shit? It's just like. Stop. It's been a little long. Remember I woke up on. Was she naked? Was she standing over you naked? No, it was just, it was like a vision of her in the same getup she had up on stage. And she was just sitting there lecturing me on. I know the political game and I am powerful. It was just, it was some fucked up shit, man. That's exactly how she talked. I know. I know. That's what I know. That's probably what resonated. And so I have been coached on how to take over your mind and impress upon you. I am never to be fucked with ever. Yeah. She does scare me though. I think she could beat the crap out of us. I think she could outwit us, beat the crap out of us. You know what I, you know, I honestly wanted to say, don't get me wrong. I thought the panel was great. I think they're all amazing. But the part of it is, it's like. I, what I wanted to say to her and I didn't run into her again at the conference. I don't know. She hopped on her jet and took off or what was going on. She had to fly out that day. I think she was in and out. Yeah. Probably. Right. At any rate. But it's kind of like, I really want to, what I'd love to talk to somebody about that, around that would be, it's like, did you change who you are to get to this stage? Meaning, and was it worth it? Are you honestly happy? I mean, I'm not talking about wealth. That's the easy part. Honestly. But did you sacrifice your values, your morals? Cause you know what amazing people like you do? They say this place is beneath me. I'm out of here. Yeah. I'm going to go find a place. You're going to treat me like that. Yeah. I'm going to. She was Citrix. She was Citrix. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. But it's kind of. Sorry. I was racking my brain this whole time. Like it wasn't. I just, I just want to ask her, well, I learned how to play the game and I'm like, good for you. But did you become something that you fucking hate? That's what I want to ask. How much did you lose? Yeah. How much of yourself did you lose? And how do you treat other women in the workplace? Thank you. Yes. That's another great question. Every woman I know that was, well, most of the women I know that reported to female bosses hated their life. Because the expectation of a female boss and their female employees were way more versus that of more publicans. And I think that's what I'm trying to say. Imagine working for Robin. Imagine working for Robin. She would tell you everything you want to know. Oh, Jake, you're the, you, you wouldn't be Jake. You'd be Jacqueline. Oh, Jacqueline. I love everything you're doing, blah, blah, blah. And then stab you in the back when you're not around. Fucking that Jacqueline doesn't do shit and I'm getting rid of Jacqueline. I just, I, it'll just like you, we've worked with really accomplished people, but I mean, seriously, at least in my adventures, 90 fucking percent of them are the most on men and women, the unhappiest motherfuckers ever. And it's just, it's like, and why are you doing this? Well, the money, well, that's the wrong motherfucking reason. But it's always the money. Why would she from Citrix flying for a 20 minute segment with arrow? Cause arrow, arrow sells to 10 billion of their shit. That's why. Well, Oh yeah. That. Yeah. I paid for it. Oh, I didn't know it so quickly. No, I don't think she got paid. I don't think she got paid. No, she probably didn't get paid. Arrow distributes. She probably felt obligated. Yeah. Arrow distributes billions of our shit. I got to come to town. So it's like, I got to, I got at least have to make a presence and it sounds like she was on a panel two years ago, but I'd love to ask her that. Like, did you, you know what I mean? Awesome. I'm glad you did that, but did you become something you fucking hate? Cause then it's not. It's not worth it. Well, I learned how to play the game well, and I understood about power and how to take my power and to keep my fucking agency again. And you know, Bob, I would like to answer my question. Did you fucking become something you hated? I have a feeling that answer is kind of, well, how about the gal from worldwide too? She seemed a little, uh, slippery worldwide technologies. The gal on my panel. Yeah. No. She seemed a little slippery too. I like the Aussie. She seemed down to earth. Now she doesn't have this high glorified job, but she seemed down to earth. The gal to her, if you're facing the stage to the left, I hung out with her and at Napa, um, a little more quiet. She's the customer service person, right? She reports directly to Ben as well. Um, but she, she throws her weight around a little bit. Sure. Yeah. I kind of laughed a few times when we were, we're having drinks. I'm like, Oh no, everybody get out of the way. Here she comes. Lisa. My wife asked, are you okay over there? Cause I really woke up. I'm like, what the fuck? And she was just lecturing me in my dreams all night. I was like, I'm going to show you power and I am power and I'm like, what the fuck? It was my sad about that is you said, you know, the one with the eyes right away, the one with the eye. And you're like, I'm going to show you power. I'm like, I'm going to show you power. You go like this. I mean, you go like this, you know, the one with the eyes and he did this with your, I just knew exactly what you're talking about. I just hate, I just hate fake people for like the moment she was asked a question. She went from this to, and my mannerisms all are the following. And it was just like, that's some fake ad. I don't, I don't do well with fake people and it's just like, and then she looked at people that left. And then. And then like I was saying, I'm like, she could, she could play what's that person in a hundred Dalmatians, 101 Dalmatians. Uh, um, the wicked one that was building coats out of Dalmatian for what's her name. That's who she could be. That's how she talked about travel, Brazil, travel. Ah, whatever. I got to, I got to run upstairs real quick to help my daughter. Apparently you go help her. I'm going to hit paradisio up. I'm going to grab something to eat and then I'm going to send out this cancellation stuff. I'll be around. We'll see you. All right. See you buddy. Bye. .
