bragger of other people and it's like anyway hopefully you see that quite a bit and I just I've marveled what you accomplished at at OST and Vervant and I just thought it was awesome and it's just it's like and I I think I love telling that story and it's like here's who my partner is and here's what our combined skill sets are and here's what we're doing it's awesome it's a cool story to tell yeah you and I both you as well right I mean just the things we've accomplished what you've done at the companies you work for in the companies you've owned and I did the same thing at Nexus as I did at OST right I didn't start the regional office but I did I did over well over a third of their overall revenue and a fourth of their profit right awesome we're gonna get there here in the next couple of years we're gonna get here I'm feeling I'm feeling I've always felt good about a message feeling really good about the message now I think we're once we get the rest of these pieces in place I mean it's such a strong story to tell we're not embarrassed that we just started the company right in fact we're excited to tell people that you know I always try to stay away from we're a new company because people are like they don't have any money we can bankrupt them what have we do what if we're in the middle of a problem we're in a problem we're in a problem we're in a problem we're in a project and they go out of business focus but we got a great story to tell around that and if we do arrows still around we're not going anywhere but arrows still around the contract would be with them or if you're buying product from us and something happens Huntington it's not like those days of a company owning everything or becoming and less and less right like like all you don't have to worry like like all companies right most have the story that in their beginnings somebody took a chance on them that they saw something and someone's gonna tell us someday very soon of course I worked with you guys I didn't get you guys yell the other stuff but I believe in you guys yep you know what I mean and that's I'm sorry I've never not had that happen in all my adventures it's always something like that was someone's like no I like what you're saying I'm sick of the would you mind hopping sorry the eco so fucking bad I hate teams. We're going to Zoom. How's that? I swear to Christ, we're just going to go to Zoom. I rebooted my machine this morning, too, thinking, all right, I'm rebooting. I'm starting fresh. It's Monday. What's going on? You know, observation. So it seems like when you get on the call before me, we have this issue. Is that what it is? Let's pay attention this week and see. I feel like when you start the call, we have this issue. But maybe I'm wrong. Actually, I didn't look at it that way. Okay. But now that you're. Mentioning it. Could be. I feel like when I'm here first and you hop in, we don't have that problem. But I could be wrong. So let's just pay attention. Not that it's going to fix anything, but it's just kind of weird. But I'm trying to figure out what the hell's fucked up on my end. Like, what is it? Like, is it the mic? Is it the what on my setup is? Teams is just like, whoa. Dude, I. It's used because you got a shit ton of stuff connected. Teams like. Whoa, man, what do I use? Good question, man. I'm just like. Anyway, I don't know. I don't know. I want to figure it out. Working on that stuff, though. I really do appreciate it. It looks really, really good. I had to bring my mom a new keyboard. One of those things when your 80 year old mother calls and like my I bought her one of those old verben OST just for when they get sell them all after three years for 150 bucks. Yeah. So I bought her one. I was like, she needed a new one. Anyway, so sick and tired of working on her 10 year old. Just like fucking done. I don't want to. I'm like, I bought you one. Here you go. I don't like change. Good for you. Here you go. Here's your new computer. Love you, mom. And then my wife looks at it. She's like, I deal with the same shit at home. Right. You just, you know, he gets sick of working on some and then it's just OK, whatever. But anyway, we. She's like my. She calls and she's like, my keyboard won't work. I'm like. Oh, you probably brought just to like the latest Microsoft updates and some got jacked up. I said, just reboot your computer. And anyway, this went on for days. She goes, my keyboard won't work. I'm like, fine. I go to a micro center in St. Louis Park, pick up a six dollar keyboard. You know, just their in-store brand. What is it? Inland or something like that. Yeah. And, you know, bring it up there. And give her a hug and walk in the office. I'm like, what's going on? I'm. I immediately. They can start typing on the laptop and she's like, what the. Like, seems to be working just fine, ma. I swear to God. And it's like, ma. She's just like, oh, my God. Anyway, it was good to see my mother. It's kind of like when your wife says there's something funny, something come from the car. Right. You go take your first thing. I didn't hear anything. That's what happened. Your mom's like, hey, at least your wife says something. My wife will turn up the radio. I don't want to listen to that. She's going to. I'm like, you didn't hear that. What? No, I just turned up the radio. I'm like, yeah. Okay. Oh, my God. God love her. As I do. It's exactly what she's doing. But anyway. So she's good to go. Did she keep the new keyboard too? Just in case. I told her to hold on to it. Just in case that because I have no doubt what happened. Microsoft jacked up everything with these latest rounds of updates. And the timing is not coincidental. This latest teams update, all these things. It's like it's I had some other minor issues with my equipment. And it's just like it's a buggy piece of shit. And I had to roll back all my systems because I'm like, what is in here? Because it's whatever it is. You guys didn't do your do your homework, man. It's not good. And so I rolled her back. And just to be sure. And I'm like, we'll wait and see what they put out on something else, man. But it ain't working. To all your cameras and stuff. Was it the team? I think so. I think so. Teams even looks different. I'm like, now I got to get used to this new layout. Like, it's like, I like the old layout. Why do you have to change it? It's like Outlook. I still like the old Outlook layout. I don't like how they do it now. It seems to be. Is it streaming better? Good. I mean, I don't know how you feel, but it seems to be streaming better. I really want to see if it works better on mobile because that's always been a freaking problem is the bandwidth issues. So I think the streaming got better. But fuck, there's just everything else now. And I'm like, what is going on? And I got to figure it out. What's conflicting with my NVIDIA software and what's going on? We'll see. We shall see. You're Microsoft and you got to think through all this shit that people run your stuff on. Right. It's endless. So how do you do all the testing and make sure everybody's covered? Is that trial and error? You kind of do the 80 percent and send it out and fix the 20? Actually, it's worse than that. They kind of do it like, OK, here's our software updates. And that's why they kind of went the route that they did. Why they're staying on these large Windows 11. You know, back in the old day, we would be on Windows 27. But it's just it's one giganto update. But they just keep updating the core. And then it's honestly, it's like a it's like I only am in a dealer concept. It's like you guys got to write all the drive for Dell and everybody else. You guys got to adjust to us. We can't adjust to you guys. But that's what causes the problem is Dell gets behind or Dell's like, what the hell did they do this for? Now we got to rewrite this, this and this. Yeah. All the drives. All the drivers have to work. All the firmware has to work. All the, you know what I mean? It's kind of. And that's why, you know, for those who like Apple, they don't have to worry about this shit. You know what I mean? It was interesting because they never ran the latest and greatest firmware for obvious reasons. And they constantly were effed. I mean, it was like, guys, I mean, if I if I had a nickel for every time I sat on a call and some OEM said, well, you're on. I'm behind drivers. Right. And firmware. I mean, I'd be retired right now. And you know what they say? That's not our problem. That's your problem. It's like you guys got to deal with a big customer like that. Right. They're like, well, no, you need to get in the latest. No, I don't. Right. You guys need to fix this shit. Yeah. They got their way every time. It's frustrating. Who got their way every time? Sorry. TR. Oh, yeah. Of course they did. Every single time. Of course they did. You fix your shit or we're done. We're done with you guys. OK, we'll come in and fix it. Just like, you know, there's security issues. I mean, it's endless. Right. If you don't do the updated firmware. But for them, whatever they would update would break a bunch of other shit. Of course. Always. So they're like, we're not always. Yeah. I'm learning six months of tests before we do that. I'm learning that, too, with all the. This cutting edge jazz with bot systems and stuff like that. All these frameworks where they're always in flux. They're always. You know what I mean? And it's just it's like everyone who's contributing, which I'm going to start doing that, too, because it's like I'm going to start publishing our stuff. It's just like, here's what works really well. Here's what's not performing. Here's what shit just breaks. You know what I mean? And it's just it's like same idea. Oh, you assholes published this. And so, you know, we have. You know, virtual Python environments are an absolute must. It's like I'm not I'm not updating this shit. You know what I mean? What Chad did do a few months ago, right? Or a month ago when they updated. It's 100 percent. You must move. And you're like, holy shit, that just broke everything. Well, they backtracked. I mean, it's just but it's like just the arrogance of like, nope, this is what it is. Like, what the fuck? We rule the universe. You guys have to like kind of what you said Microsoft does with the OEMs. Guys, we're going. We're going to release a new one on this date. And here it is for you guys to build your shit on. Right. But you need to take care of it. But they're supposed to say the same thing. We're going to move forward. You guys figure it out. And everybody's like, you just broke all of our models. Like, what the fuck? Well, it's kind of a it's just one big ecosystem. Right. And they're like, OK, OEM, here's your night 60 or 90 day heads up. You know what I mean? Here's the latest. But it's not complete software. They're still working on it. And it's like, well, here you'll see the direction that we're going. Oh, thank you. That's freaking helpful. OK. So you're telling, you know, I mean, in those scripts and everything change. And it's just like, fuck a doc, man. And I get it. Everything's moving so quickly. But anyway, we'll see. But it's just it's a it's something else, man. So I'm going to say something else. Security for us. Right. So you go into the future. We talk about managed services, managing. Right. Their agents. Their whatever it might be. They're going to need help. Their models will manage it for you. And this is why it's important. They're going to see it right away. After, like you said, after they get 20 models up there, they're going to be like, holy shit. And then they get to the hundreds. And like, it's out of control. Like, we need a team. It's kind of like managing ETLs. Right. We got a team of 30 that just manage our models. I can't believe that. Is that a good spend of their time? Couldn't you do it for cheaper? I was outlining this weekend the video I want to make for Ipsos. And that's the core of it, which is. Hopefully, I emphasize that in our talk. But it's like, here's why you do not want to use LLMs for this shit. Holy crap. I'm like, what? And I totally get it. I get where it came from. Oh, here's these all these available things that we'll download. Will you? Is it's like, what the fuck would you do that for? Especially in their world. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Easy. Oh my God. Yeah. Oh. You got me. I just, holy shit. I can already see, like, for where she started, you know, people are just like doing stuff with AI and not even reading their stuff or what not. Actually, it's even worse than that. How many hallucinations are there? are sitting in there and that's where like you heard from who told us that i think it was keith abridge is already seeing the limitation of lms and it's just like of course they are you know what a doctor is going to look like this isn't accurate oh and what does that mean for that's a lawsuit i don't know what it is yeah oh can you still hear me so you get diagnosed with something but you don't have it because your doctor got some weird you know glitch in their report because it was all ai generated i'm sorry you only have two months to live and then you find out in a month oh sorry that was just a glitch we fixed the problem you're okay you have nothing to worry about i mean what i've never used this job i've been smoking a pack of cigarettes a day thinking this is it for me yes i never i haven't used i haven't used i haven't used i haven't used i haven't used i haven't used i haven't used i haven't used the software but i mean i would have to imagine i mean i would hope it's like where's the raw data the raw transcription you'd have to imagine they would have to have both you know what i mean i assuming it does i just don't i don't know that but i would assume it does it correlates the dictation and the core information and ties it together same way our system works right raw data comes in but then it's transformed uh from so now dictating my notes from meeting with the patient and if i say something that doesn't align you think you'd get a flag right like hey you said pancreatic cancer but really this person has something to do bone can or well you know what i mean but somehow you think it would flag it like is there any anonymous anomalies between what i'm saying and what was in the report right the live data that's a great question and you would hope they're still going through all that stuff to make sure it's accurate and i'm sure they are and i'm sure they are and i'm sure they are and i'm sure they are and is that a is that that is that still a time saver probably but still i would can only imagine yeah i'm sure doctors are complaining of like this shit ain't right i can't risk this and this was like whoa it went wildly off of these other things and it's like all right you take your feedback but then you're constantly tweaking the models you're like turning the dials and you but then you got to test it and it's just like holy ball i mean it's like a you know what i mean you gotta it's tough it's tough it's really tough and it's like plus think of like a language slash dictionary slash or whatever of these terms of like you know what i mean here's you know i mean where you've essentially taught it you know medical language if you will yeah so before i forget because i wanted to bring this up keith keith scheduled a dinner with um aaron in dallas thursday night next week do we want to divert our flight and go to dallas do we want keith to do it alone i mean i kind of got mixed feelings to be good in front of aaron is it going to move the dial at all maybe um be good to see him but is it worth doing that for an hour dinner or two hour dinner like what are your thoughts i told keith i talked to you because i said keep the biggest problem is we leave we don't leave new orleans till the afternoon on the 13th and you want to speed to dallas for dinner we'd have to rearrange our schedule to get there and can we get there in time and then you know is there value to you for us being there he wants us to be there she doesn't have any technical help but i'm thinking and do we want to do that like is that a good spend of our time and money i would say no it's weird i have a hard time so i want to get in front of aaron and i want to hang out with them but i'm coming to the same conclusion as you because i told jen over the week and i'm like because i told her on friday i'm going to go to dallas i'll be home probably friday instead of thursday and then and then over the week i'm like god my gut my gut's telling me no but i really want to be in front we need to be in front of these guys right and i'm like my gut just tells me no you like my gut was like you're the better fit we get to a point where we got people working for us and they can hold down the fourth and we're probably going to go to some of this stuff together but it's like um i don't know i you keep going but that was just my gut i feel weird about it but i feel like it's the right choice normally i would like i'd be all over this stuff like that but you have to look at the reality of where we stay where we stand with him and the fact is there's um what have they done they pushed octopi which he's like indifferent about we did we we don't know where where dean ended and here's the point it's kind of like if there was an agreement with keith that we are no more ps we're now leading this thing with optim um you know what i mean and i'm like i'm not going to be able to do that i'm not going to be able to do that that it's our we're developing our relationship with them i think we should consider that because you know how it how difficult it is to get time with executives and that we would have his attention he knows who we are but that we could redirect the entire conversation away from fucking octopi and just whatever we gave him a solution budget was his limitation um but i'd have to say right now we don't know where anything is at so i would say i mean better for him to go back find on thursday like where are we at right he doesn't yeah yeah and we can give him some pointers right ask him these pointed questions and then we'll come down and do uh or when he's up here i mean he's up here once in a while shake and i'll take him to dinner and we'll we'll you know we'll get more out of them well the reality the reality is my guts tell me the same thing thing i feel bad about it because i want to get in front of aaron i just i feel the same way as you it's like i mean an hour meeting i cannot have any control over the conversation seems kind of like a waste of time i want control moving forward and it's kind of like no we'll support you and help you but we gotta be like there's gotta be an understanding of what what's in it for you got we gotta be aligned right we're leaving you know we're leaving you know we're leaving you know we're leaving you this thing like kind of what we did with oshkosh it's kind of like hey you know what i mean and i i'll be blunt if um fucking why am i forgetting his name marcos no shane thank you if shane dices us on this one i'll be done with him you gotta weep weep go ahead on us taking that yeah shane did send you a note this morning Marcos' comment back. Did you see that? No. I've been writing bios and stuff. Yeah, did you see it? Marcos has got back as far as the level they're on. No, he told us this last week, but awesome. No, I get it. For now, we have no plans to support Azure Gov under FedRAMP, but I've been asking for it for years. Let's recap next week. What's the fucking difference if they're approved in the DoD? Why would they not do that? Again, this is Marcos from his conversation, but Marcos wasn't on your call, was he? No. Not at all. So, this is Marcos not knowing what you talked about. No, I'm looking at this line here. For now, we have no plans to support Azure Gov under FedRAMP. How is that possible when you guys are an approved DoD vendor? How is that possible when you guys are an approved DoD vendor? And guess what? That's all in Gov. What the fuck? And it's kind of like, why are you telling you're telling me your press release was wrong? I don't think so. So, why isn't one hand talking to the other? Or tell me what's, you know what I mean? Or did Shane misunderstand him? I don't know. It's one or the other. But anyway, I'm going by your press release press release, which I think, you know, I've been saying it's a big freaking deal for this whole time, and I'd be flexing that shit out. Shit like nobody's business. If I was them, in terms of marketing and publicity wise, but it's like, either way, it's like, if I found out that Shane went with Marcos and whoever with Oshkosh behind us now, I'd be really fucking pissed. And we're going to have it out. And it's just, you know what I mean? We have to say we're done. Wow. We're not. We're not. Well, in a way, just say, you know, if we're not going to have it out, we're not going to have it out. If you're going to lead, but you want our help, then we need to be assigned to every single thing that you bring in with that account. Well, I want to. I want to. Whether it goes to us or not. We want 100% credit. Don't get me wrong. I want a partnership. I'm not just saying it's our way or the highway, but I want a partnership. But it's very clear PS believes that they're in control, which that's our disagreement. And I think in more cases than not, you're following our lead. It's like, look, you guys are going to. Grab X deals and grab me. Fine. Focus on renewals. We can't stop that. You guys are going to be doing that stuff. Right. But on some of these other pieces, God damn it. You know what I mean? Yeah. But. So what are we going to do? Talk to Shane and Marcos and be like, hey, guys, what? Well, I'm going to send them the press release. I'll respond and say how. What? What? You guys are approved and you have no. No plans to support Azure Gov. Well, that's interesting. So that's I'm literally I'm going to respond back. Be like, you guys just announced this in July. What are you saying? I mean, literally, what are you saying? You could even send that to Joel member on the Gov side and be like, Joel, you guys support FedRAMP, right? You're going to get back. Hilarious. And be like, oh, yeah, of course. It's like, but this is the point. It's like, you guys understand you check every box within FedRAMP, right? You know what I mean? So anyway, I don't all know what's going on there, but we'll help figure it out. But I think this is the. I think it's one of those classic cases where for that's part of Cloudera's transformation, which is you have such a lot of people. A large team supporting all the old shit. And they're trying to innovate so quick at the same time. People can't keep up. Yeah. You know what I mean? Or sorry, it's there's probably publishing a million things. But how does a person work with clients? I mean, you're working 97 hours a week trying to keep up with everything. Yeah, it's frustrating. Right. Yeah. It's a challenge. Yeah. Because that sounds like a great option. And Ron did. We don't have many people signed. Up so far for her event coming up on the 17th. But Ron did accept. Good. So I got to really push that hard this week. I've sent a note to every single person we've talked to. I got to go back to Bruce again. Bruce, we just talked the other day or on our call this week with them. Like, hey, I think it's worth your time to be on this call. Like, join. Yeah. No, I'll push it, too. And we'll send out. I send off new messages today. Yeah. And. Yeah. I'd love to get some of Shane's accounts locally here. Right. Ryan's accounts. I'm going to look up. Now, what I haven't done is I haven't gone through. Maybe I'll do that today is get a tool where we can find everybody's titles and names and shit. Maybe it's just that Apollo AI for now or Apollo IO. Then we'll get the names and emails and we can send it out. Right. I'm marketing HR. Sign it up for both of us. Let's try it for 30 days. We don't like it, dude. We kill it. Don't. That's true. Don't buy the like the annual one. Do the monthly. We'll see if it's as good as it's reported to be. Let's find out. We use it for 30 days. We don't like it. It costs us 120 bucks or something for two seats. Not even. Yeah. What was I can't remember what it was. Three different packages, depending what you want. And I think it was like from. I think it was like $7 a month or like 50, but I can't remember what the differences were. And I'll go look at that this morning yet. And because I did two weeks ago, three weeks ago when I did the cold calling that one week. Right. I called 40, 30 or 40 companies. I had to spend. I spent hours trying to find the right contacts. Right. I mean, it's LinkedIn only. So because you can't Google them. So you're out there. You can. If they have a board listed or executives list on their Web page. But even then you can't get their email addresses. Right. So I think it's a worthwhile investment. We play with a couple of things real quick and same thing on this one. And let's just, I think, take a peek, see what it is. I'd say let's just do it. Let's give it a roll for 30 days, like through Thanksgiving. We'll make a decision if it's the right tool or not. Let's give it a roll. See what happens. Let's do it. Let me just make note of that. I am just as you're reading through the other stuff, I'm just going to finalize the business plan package. And if you're cool on the other stuff, give me the just send me a quick text on the thumbs up of your good or you've made minor changes. And I'll just throw that all into the package that we'll send over this morning. Yeah, I'm good with the credit memo. I read it again this morning and the full version. So I'm good. And the appendix is cool. I. I look into. Cool. So I'll read the original things from today and I'll let you know. Yeah. Make. Shit, I didn't do the. The cover letter is just an email. If you have changes to it, just make them in the email and just send it back to me. So I didn't put that in a word doc. The bios are in a word doc, so you can just change them directly. And that anyways, as an email. So. Cool. And then what else do we got? Dover video. I'm finishing up the Ipsos video. What's up? Yeah, probably video and Ipsos. Ipsos. Yeah. And I'll call Mark this morning. My buddy who's dating or married. I'm not sure which one the young. So I'll call him. I got to call Rob to make sure he can still meet this afternoon. That's the service. Now meeting. Obviously the Apollo. I owe up. He just sent. I got to get back to Tom on his email from last week where he apologized for these companies just asking to get into our accounts. So I'll get back to him. He read that, right? What else do we got? Not my whole package. I'm just going to. I'm going to do it. I've got a lot of stuff coming over from all the videos and stuff that you asked for and our stock portfolio, putting all those things together. So that was a bigger to do. I was way bigger than what I thought it was because there's so much to talk about. It's endless. I could go on. Jesus Christ. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome. Thank you so much for doing that. That's going to be huge. That's going to be so nice. I wonder if we should do on on the vibe coding webinar. We're going to be putting some stuff on there. that we're going to be hosting. Do on what? A new video that just talks about what we're going to talk about on the webinar. To send off in our emails? Yes. Okay. Okay. I'm just wondering, what are your thoughts on... Sometimes, I mean, I think of a video like, you know, you get an email like you and I, I'm sure you get the same as me. I get probably at least three to five emails a week, join this seminar or do this webinar. It could be Cloudera, Arrow, other AI companies, but I get a bunch, right? Some come from LinkedIn, and I don't ever read any of it. I'll read if it's Cloudera or Arrow, but otherwise, I don't. But maybe, and that's probably how other people feel, but maybe if you get a video and you're like, let me just watch this, and they get a feel for what it's about, it might entice them there. Especially if you don't know the people we're reaching out to. Speaking of funny, 7.41am, Lisa Illick. Good morning, friend. Want to meet up for coffee sometime in November, December. I want to pick your brain on adjunct professor stuff. Also would love to hear how you are. Oh my god, this is code for something else. We still have not talked until afterwards. She knows I'm still pissed. She can't stand the fact that I'm pissed at her. She doesn't want anybody angry at her. Right? I'm still pissed. Still pissed. Probably even more pissed today than I was in January. January. Send her a text back and be like, I'll meet with you as soon as you admit your, you're wrong. Yeah. As soon as you can admit you're wrong and you ran this company into the ground, I'll meet with you. She was already going to the ground. She just was the autopilot. Keep it going down. You gotta, I mean, you gotta decide. Meaning, I know Mara told her don't take this job because of Coney Egg. What? That's a, you gotta decide. You know what I mean? What? How do you want to put it? You just, you gotta decide. Do you want to go along with leadership or you just, or you just want to just walk? Well, and are you the right fit, right? So she knew, well, maybe she didn't even know because she might have been so clueless about the situation, but I don't know. She should have been able to look at the company and go, am I the right person? Our sales have been like this for two years now. Am I the right person to right the ship or not? And I think she's arrogance isn't the word. Naive enough? She was naive enough to think that she could do a good job. She had no control over the leadership group. In fact, it was almost like she was lower ranking as CEO than like a Robin and some of those people, right? I would agree. Yeah. So it's like either you lead or you don't take the job. And she wasn't, she wasn't the right fit. If we needed another rah-rah person because we're doing good, just, hey, rah-rah, let me know what you need. She would have probably been pretty good at that. Sometimes. I like her. It's no rip on her. I would have been in the same boat. I wouldn't have been able to pull that thing out of the nosedive it was going down. I would have crashed and burned just as bad, but I would have been like, there's no way in hell I'm taking that job. Right? That's the difference. I mean, 2022 is the company's best year ever. I mean, that's where that's what she inherited. I mean, that literally, but I, you know, you, everyone saw the clouds coming, but at the same time, but it's like, sorry, what's the old hockey metaphor or even basketball? I think it's both hockey and basketball. Sometimes you just got to throw a fucking elbow. The elbow, if she, I wonder if you asked her, like, if you were to throw an elbow back in, when was September of 2022 was what the month of Mare before she walked, right? They celebrated Mare for literally a month. And then like, and I'm, in October, what's the first thing she could have done? Tell Jim to walk. Yeah. Jim, you're out. Jim, you're out. You're demoted, right? Or Robin, you're gone too. Robin had her, Robin had her fucking snowballed. Well, we also told her about Robin and then what she do, promoted her. Right. Well, I still want to know if Robin was the final one that put six daggers in her back. That's what I want to know. And I guarantee you she was. She helped. She might not have been like the one sticking it, but she was pushing. Tush pushing. Well, it makes you wonder because Lisa told me Ron was talking about hiring, you know, that Allen position for six months before he did it or something like that. And Lisa said, don't do it, Ron. If you do, I'm going to be gone or whatever. And maybe she didn't say that, but she said, don't do it because of this and that. And Ron kind of kicked the can down the road and then just went and did it. And it makes you wonder, did he do it because Robin went to him and said, hey, we got no leadership in this company. We need somebody from Koenig managing us. Maybe. But to your point, though, she's still there. She survived the whole thing. How? When the company's finances have never been worse, how is the CFO still there? Because her and Ron had something, I bet you. I think you're right. I think you're 100% right. Or whatever it is. But, I mean, she's an awesome chameleon, but she is so full of shit. I'll go and tell your wife. You got to wonder, right? It's the only thing that makes sense. Nothing else makes sense. We've all met with Robin and we saw right through her bullshit, right? Oh, yeah. In fact, what I saw was she was not qualified to run a sales company. Would she have been good in operations as a manufacturer? Maybe. But she was not suited for a sales organization at all. That's what we were. We're a big sales company, right? I mean, it's no different than here. We're a sales organization. We sell things. It's easy to say you measure leadership by the quality of the people around the leaders. I think that's part of it. A lot of people view that as the whole picture. There's different things there. There's some depends there, right? But it's a big part of the picture. And if like when Robin coming in, you looked at that finance team, I would have fired all of them. You're unqualified. You're all unqualified. I don't care whose niece, nephew, whatever the fuck you all got going on here. None of you are accountants or at least a controller has. And that was essentially Tracy's role. None of you have a CPA. But we're experts in the... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wow. And it's just... That's unfortunately the story of... A big part of the story of OST was wrong people, wrong position. Unqualified people in the wrong positions. But yet they were friends. And they all went to the same church. I'm all for loyalty and I'm all for those other pieces. But there's a part of your ego that has got to be like, what's best for the business? Just saying. And balancing those two things. We were a separate company still and we're looking for somebody in that role and Dan Beam was running it. Would they have hired Robin? Probably not. You know him better than I do. I've only met the man. I've only talked to him five times in ten years. Now Cognac owns you and it's all about just building your company up and Robin gets this job. I don't know. I think if it was the old school OST, they should have never got hired. Whatever. Everyone would have still been in that role so they wouldn't have needed her. Right. Yeah, this is a it's kind of funny. I was waiting. I knew this text was going to come. It was just a mess because I have not gotten back to her. We've always said we were going to get together. And I just told her, I said, this is going two ways, man. It's you and I either having Manhattans, getting drunk and telling each other off or kind of whatever. I knew it was coming, but it's just, I'm probably not going to engage and just be like, I don't want to. Sure, I'll have coffee with you or something like that, but it's just you want to talk about adjunct, whatever. I just think that's funny. Sorry. What do you think she wants to talk about? I don't care, Mike. It's like bottom line. It's like she's not even on my radar. I don't know how she can help us. I'm all for always looking for strategic alliances, but she, I don't even know what the hell that business even is. What kind of a marketing thing is it? It's just not aligned to our business. Don't get me wrong. Do I want to see if we could help her? It's a small firm, right? Probably sure as hell not. I don't know if they're bigger. I'll entertain it and be like, see if we can get some business there, but you know what I mean? I just do I have that firm wrong? I'm all for it, but my deal was it was like a 10 person firm or 15 person firm. Do I have that firm? I'm all for it. I'm all for it. Well, if it's the company she told me about, it was a real it was a real small company that a neighbor or a friend owned that wanted her to come over and run it. Right. Right. So, I gotta ask you, Jen saw in the news this morning Scott Galloway. Do you know who that is? Dr. Scott Galloway. He's a professor. Why do I know that name? Go ahead. He wrote a new book and it's exactly what you've been saying about the white male. Like, you know, you're talking about that legendary dude or guy who's like at, not Brown. Fuck. Yeah, he's always on MSNBC. I don't watch MSNBC, but being a little bit on the right side, I think he wrote MSNBC. But she, so I told her what you told me. Oh, yeah, yeah. I know who he is. Yeah, Stern School of Business. Yeah, I know who this guy is. Jen, I don't know if you knew who he was, but she's gonna buy the book. He was on, I think, the Today Show this morning and she said it was it was a really kind of inspiring book that he wrote about, it's like what you said, you know, back in the 50s the white male dominated the workforce, right? Now they've spent so much time since then to get the white male out of those roles that these white white men, and there's many things that this book is about, right? But it just talks through this where like the white young guy is at today, right? Living at home in their parents' basement, all the stuff you said, right? And he wrote this whole book on you know, how to get out, and it's not just for white kids, right? It's for all kids. Like Jen said, the uh Craig, or whatever that's on the Today Show with Black Guy, he read the book, he's like, it's one of the best books I've read this year and stuff like that, but it all is about what you said, right? Men are, the boys, the men aren't men anymore, and they're not, you know, it's like women want to have somebody that, you know, can take care of them. It doesn't have to be income-wise, not everybody's going to have an income that's going to be able to allow your wife to stay home. But a manly man that works hard and, you know, puts his family first, and it even talks about how a lot of guys have never asked a girl out in person, right? It's all on Instagram, or however they do it, right? Snap, or whatever. I don't have tools. So, you could have wrote that book, bud. You could have wrote that a couple years ago. I just see it firsthand. He's not wrong, if that's the premise of the book. That's totally, he's just told me high level, but I'm like, I'll ask him. Well, he's a professor at the Stern School. He's seeing the exact same thing. It's like, what the fuck happened? You know what I mean? Yeah. I come from a, my German grandmother sent me, I don't know about you, my German grandmother sat me down when I was young and she's like, I remember these speeches, and she would like open the Bible and I'd be like, oh shit, here we go. And I'm like seven years old, right? And she would be like, and she'd tell me stuff like, do you know why you know, it's like grandson, do you know why, in her thick German accent, right? Do you know why the lion and the eagle are the two most often mentioned animals in the Bible? And I'm seven. No. You know what I mean? But her point in terms of life was be them. Yeah. You know, she would always, it was like yesterday, we're sitting in her, she's got her fucking Yeah, she's like, she's got her Folgers, I can smell like I'm back there again in Glencoe. And she'd be like, this is what you want to be in life, right? She's like, the eagle has vision. Best vision of any animal on the planet. Can see what, what is it, like three miles, five miles, seven miles, whatever. It's like, but anyway, it can see, it's like you don't have a chance in fucking hell. That thing's going to spot you from miles away and you're fucked. It's like the point about the eagle has vision, she would say. Then she'd go on and say like, the lion's not the biggest animal on the planet. It sure as hell not the fastest. It's not the whatever. But yet the lion's the king. And she's like, and she'd go on for a half an hour on like, this is why God equates, uses these examples. And it's a way to, but her point was, this is a way to live. And it's something I've always agreed with. You know what I mean? And it's just, it's like aligned to what, no doubt, Dr. Galloway is talking about here. He's like, that is lost on men. I look at the men that are like walking around Concordia, I'm like, what the fuck? No confidence, no game. Afraid to talk to women. Across all nationalities. Yeah. Across everything. It doesn't matter if they're Indian, Chinese, Jews, Christians, Hindus. Doesn't matter. It's like something happened. You know, I'm sorry, how does Trump, or who, not Trump, or Trump probably said this too, the pussification of men. Oh yeah. And the military's seeing it too. It's like, what the fuck? It's like, it's like, and these are now, it's like you dooders have turned into angry assholes because you can't get a girl, you can't get fucking laid, you're living on porn sites in your mom's basement, and you're angry at the world. And what Scott is, I've heard some of his talks before. He said that about the porn too. He's like, if porn was around when I was a kid, I might not have dated anybody either, right? I mean, there's some truth there. What would we when we were kids not saying this is right? We're little guys, right? We want to go out and hang out with the chicks and oh dear. Right? That's what it was. You throw porn in the mix and you take that equation out of the way and then it's like, you know, you don't know how to talk to them. You get the wrong ideas watching that shit, right? How to treat women. I mean, it's just, I don't know. It's not just that, it's all the, you know, and then when you're on like an Instagram or TikTok, they just keep feeding you the shit you're watching. So if you're a little more depressed, you're going to get a bunch of depressing shit. It's just going to keep feeding you that stuff, right? Well, it's like, don't get me wrong. I'm all for evolution and change and it's like, I'm glad there was certain changes over the last, you know, five decades. Meaning in terms of women's rights and like back when you and I were born, women couldn't even get loans on their own. I'm sorry, right before we were born. Sorry, women couldn't even get loans on their own without a male signature. I'm all for equality and all those other pieces, but it's like, and I'm sorry, but, but men are going to be men. This is how we're built, but it's like for Jesus Christ and it's like now you have a really angry generation and I think that's probably Scott's point. Sitting in these basements, they're fucking mad and they want somebody to blame other than themselves. Why? Because they have no goddamn character, no damn integrity to look in the mirror and be like, why am I a fuck up today? Nobody wants to do that. They just want to blame and it's like we become this truly pussy fucking culture and it's just it's frustrating to watch and it's just like, and what I'm trying to instill in my boys is that exact same thing. It's like where I told them, it's like you guys have the world by the fucking oyster. You're growing up in a generation with a bunch of fucking bozos and my son, I think I told you that story. My son came to me as a sophomore, junior in high school. He's like, this is the greatest ever. I can get any girl I want, man. I can just look him in the eye and be like, how are you today? And they're like, oh, and he's like, panty drop. I'm like, don't tell your mom that shit. Because I'm going to tell your dad. Don't tell your mom that stuff. But as your dad, I'm like, okay, but you know, but a way to go, son. And it's just, you know what I mean? It's just but it's like, you're not going to sit at home and blame other people. Fuck. You know what I mean? I won't let you. I said, I'll kick your ass if you do that. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, dwell away. Go down, you know. That's okay if you hibernate down there and don't worry about it. And it's like, we're like you. We're like, fuck off to video games. Get outside. Go get a job. Go play sports. Yeah. You got to do something. If you want to play some video games, we got no problem with that, but it's not what you're going to do all day. Well, I'm telling my kids, I'm like, take advantage. Let the other fuckers stay at home and sit and whatever. You get to go do whatever the fuck you want to do. Take advantage. Build the life that you want. Whatever. I just want you to be happy. But oh my god, you're not wrong and your competition is like, yeah, go the hell. You got the world's your freaking oyster. Yeah. Go do that. And it's like, but it's, I'm glad he wrote a book because it's like I said, anyone who... She's like, it's a good book. It looks good. I'm like, yeah, let's read it. Then let's have our boys read it, right? And Sam. Sam will get something out of it too. Anyone who teaches, sees it firsthand, you're like, what the fuck? Well, Tanner, he stopped hanging out with all of his high school buddies. He only hangs out with one now. He had a big group from all the sports. I'm like, why? And he goes, I just feel like, you know, kind of like the press number on them. They put everybody down and they're just... These are all kids that were good athletes, right? And he's just like, I'm buddies with them because I played sports. I played sports with them, but his true friends are all his frat buddies at school because they're all similar. They all have the same... They're all really good people. These guys are too. I'm not ripping on these guys because I like them and all their parents, but for him, he's just like it's just not the life he wanted to continue to lead with those guys because he felt like shit when he was around them, right? He's like, I'm going to go do my thing and I'm going to grow and live with each other in their colleges and they hang out all summer and he's like, I don't want that. I have dear friends. I got really good high school buddies, right? He was buddies with them more because of sports, he thinks, right? I have a group of friends I grew up with who are still pissed at me to this day and they blame my wife that I don't hang around with them anymore even though I've told them the truth, which is we want to lead very different lives. One of them is 50... No, what is John? He's my brother's age, so he's 53 and lives at home with his mom and dad along with his older brother. And it's like, don't get me wrong, financial crisis wiped him out, but it's like, as I've told him... 55 or 50 or whatever? 53. He's your age. He's 53 because you're what, 52, 53? I'll be 53 in January. Yeah, he's basically your age, right? I just turned 50, but it's like, I tell John... I've done everything to help John. And John, he came through the MBA program at Concordia, too. Tried to turn his life around, and I was proud of him and stuff like that, but god damn that fucking guy. And this is... I think I probably have mentioned him to you before. Aced the ACT and got, like, whatever. Smart as they come. But... The country knows him stuff, right? Jesus. It's so frustrating, and it's just... It's like... But it's like, you lead the life you want, which is in your mom and fucking dad's basement at 53. Years old. And don't get me wrong. I totally get the financial crisis wiped you out and whatnot, but I said, you know what? How I look at it? Great! I get to start over! Guess what I get to do? I get to start from scratch! And I get to build again. He's been complaining about that shit for 15 years. Yeah. Before you know it, 20 years goes by, and you're no farther along than you were 20 years ago. Oh my god! And... That's what you gotta suck it up. Have your moment. Life sucks. I just gotta fuck. And then pull yourself up by your bootstraps and go get a job. Start building all over again. It's just... 15 years after the fact, and he's still got nothing going on. I think he's a... I mean, he's got a daughter. She's in, like, college now. Has to be. And it's just... It's like... It's... It's just frustrating. It's just like... It's hard to... I love all those guys, like, brothers. If they ever needed something, I'd be there from them. But there's a couple things I've always refused. I'm not giving you money to frickin'... What are you gonna do with it? Buy an Xbox? Literally? That's what we're gonna do? And he's a 53-year-old gamer. I'm all for games. 40 hours a week? He games? Yes! It's like... Here's the difference. You're saying I'm a terrible friend because I don't go out and drink with you guys four nights a week. You can already see where his budget goes and why he lives with mom and dad. Four nights a week. Golf on the weekends. Trips. You know, do whatever. And I'm already doing the math, which I can't even, like... I love my friends, but it's like... I can't hang with you. I'll come hang with you every now and then, but I'm not spending all my money on this stuff. Friends do. I'm like, well, I want my friends to build the lives that they want. I'm not gonna sit here and be fucking broke and live paycheck to paycheck. Seriously? Seriously? It's just... It's so frustrating. I love all those guys, but they're still pissed at me to this day. They're like, you've kind of excluded yourself from us. Yeah, because you're leading the life that I don't want. Believe me. If I were... And if I were John's parents, if I were Dan and Phyllis, right? John and I's mother share the same name. I thought my mom was... I was the only Phyllis I knew in the world, but whatever. I'd kick my sons of the curb and being like, you got 10 days to get the fuck out of here and go build the life that you want. Jesus. Jesus. When the crisis hits, you're like, hey, I always have a spot here. We'd love to help you, but you got a year, right? I'll give you a year, but you gotta get out of here in a year. You're gonna pay me the rent. You gotta treat me like a little kid. You're gonna give me the money like you're renting, and I'll put it into an account for it. Oh, my God. John's such a... What's that term? Hyprochondriac. He's always sick. There's always something wrong. Right? Oh, I'll move out, but... Oh, my fucking shoulder. Or my... I don't even know what sciatica even is. My sciatica's acting up, or whatever. What is sciatica? I don't even know what the hell it is. Sciatica is the nerve that goes down your back, right? Is that what it is? Yeah, my sciatica is acting up again. That's just John. Oh, yeah, I'll do it next week. And it's just like... I was proud of him for finishing his degree, and it was... He finished, he graduated, he had good grades, everything else like that, but what has he done with it? That's why I won't see him, because he's gonna be like, see, this is a fucking waste of time and money. It's like, what did you do with it? And why would I be impressed by you in an interview? And so what are you gonna have to do? Well, I live at my parents' house. I haven't had a job in five years. My sister just ran into him like a month ago. Because they go to the same church. And they sometimes see him, sometimes they don't, because John just sits in the back and complains about the fucking world and whatever, right? Blames God for God knows what. And then, but she said she saw him in like Cub Foods or something. And I was like, so, yeah, how's John doing? She goes, oh my god. She goes, all he did was complain for 20 fucking minutes. About how shit life is. And I'm like, so nothing's changed. He's just one of those guys. I love John. I've always loved John. Right? We were the best. He's still, he's my brother, but he's just fucking lost. And it's like, I'm done trying to help him. Is he gonna figure it out? I mean, he doesn't have a shit ton of time left. I know it changes life, but, he and I really separated. We were having a drink at, where were we, in Wiper Lake somewhere. And he literally asked me, he's like, so how much money is in your checking account? I'm like, none of your business. He's like, none of your business. I'm like, why? I said, you've known me, I've been this way since birth. I don't talk about my personal situation with people. It's none of their business. You know what I mean? I just, it's none of your, my, my personal finances are none of your business. I said, that's a discussion for my family, my spouse. I said, that's it. Well, You're the only one that knows out of everybody we know. Yeah, pretty much. And it's like, I don't, I don't tell anybody. Nor does anybody ask. So, nor do I ask. I don't know why you would care. You know, my life is my life. Your life's your life. Rock on with your bad selves. Right? That's my view. But anyway, no, he was just like, he was trying to say, he was basically trying to say, I need money. You could write a big ass check to me right now and help me out. And I'm like, and I, You said that? Well, I'm paraphrasing what was said, but he was kind of, he was afraid to ask for it. And it's just like, what are you asking me? I said, you know me, you've known me long enough and I've never, I have not changed. Cut the bullshit. What do you want? And it's like, well, this was like not too long after like 2014. I can't remember when the first one was. I don't know how long it was. And it was just like, but our relationship changed after that. It's like, don't get me wrong, dude. If you were in desperate fricking straights, health, you know, you got cancer and all of a sudden, you know, you had a medical bankruptcy and shit. I said, dude, no, I would be the first one there. Right? That's just, that's your Delta shitty fucking hand. And you need some help right now. Right? And we'll get you on your feet. And if you want, and I would never even ask for the money back. You know what I mean? We'll just get you on your feet. So this is different. You work your job that you've always hated, which he did pretty much does inside sales for like, um, like HVAC components and shit worked at Honeywell for a period of time, stuff like that. Right. And it's like me, if I was in your position, I'd be like fucking great. I can work three jobs right now. I'll do inside sales. I'll drive a new, probably I'll amp this up and get a bunch of money and then, you know, decide what I want to do. Because you again, if you helped other people get paid to actually do stuff for you, John would never do that. That's what I would do. I'd be working day and night. I already build this fucking thing. Here we go. You know what I mean? And it's not worth it, right? John? John gooseustom. And he's like, I'm not spending the time, John. John goes home and after seven and a half hours, all, what a day? Oh, I'm tired. And to come home and have a beer. dying. well knowing him, I don't think his diet's changed one goddamn bit. Have a beer, have some pizza. What game's on tonight? And I'd be like, no, he's going to go game for two and a half hours. Maybe watch the Wolves. Maybe watch some football. Maybe watch some whatever. And next thing you know, it's 10 o'clock. It's like he's 20 years old. I just told him, I said, that's the difference between you and I. What? I said, if I was in your exact same situation, you wouldn't want to be in my situation. I said, why not? I said, I'd view it as a fucking challenge. Why not? I would have three jobs right off the bat. I would have gotten myself out of my parents' basement. Fucking A, right? I would have. I would work my way up in some company at some point. I'm just saying. Does it want to be outside sales? Work your way up into outside sales? Don't get me wrong. For other folks, I'd be talking to everyone. I'd be like, John, it's criminal. He's so intelligent. He's as smart as they come. That's what's criminal. This is a... It sounds like lazy as hell. Fuck. And expect somebody to take care of it. Yeah. And it's just like, if you're waiting for Cindy Crawford to knock on your door, guess what, brother? It ain't for... I love that 1980 whatever was Diet Pepsi commercial, too. I still revere it. If my wife would let me, that poster would still be on the wall. But... Hey, you got your space in the basement. I think you should get a poster. But... And John's... I think I have a massive ego. Then there's John. John's ego is out of control. And it's just kind of like... I also know that Cindy ain't coming to my door. I'm not afraid to say that. She's probably not into the chubby professor vibe. Something telling me. You never know. You never know. That's what I tell my wife. You represent the chubby, gray-haired professor. Business owner contingent. She's like, great. It's awesome. So you're speaking it for the women out there, right? I'm like, oh my God. She's like, God help me now. I've seen a number of you walking around. You're like, I saw you looking at them. I saw you checking them off. John's one. And if I were to run into him... Because it's hunting season, right? And deer opener is next weekend. Which I always go. I always go out with my buddies and stuff. And... Yeah. He's like, how can you do that? And I'm like, what do you mean? I love having this debate with people. But it's like... And I always try to use this as an example, which has never resonated with him. And I'm like, I am all down for people who don't like herding animals and these other pieces, where I view it as just a part of nature. But I view that there's a deep respect there. Like, I waste nothing. That goes to feed people. You're not just killing animals. No. You're killing them and eating them. I don't kill animals for sport. I bring that. I fill my fucking freezer. Yeah. We eat that stuff. It becomes chili. It becomes roast. It becomes sticks. It becomes all these things. We donate the hides to... Oh, I love a little stroganoff with that. I just... I love it. And like I said, some people don't want to do that, right? They view it as immoral and those other pieces. But yet they eat a steak. That would be John. He has no problem eating a steak, but he doesn't want to do the dirty work. And I just... And I'm like, no problem. But it's like kind of hypocritical, isn't it? Why the... If you were a rocked down vegetarian and you were like down, I'm like, I would respect your views. And one, I should probably adopt some of your pieces for health reasons. And that's cool, right? But I'm like, holy balls, man. But it's like, you can't... You don't get it both ways. Don't eat your freaking porterhouse. Which, by the way, given your current state, I wouldn't be eating porterhouses. I'd be eating rice and beans and saving every dime. Yeah. Yeah. I would. Grilled cheese. Yes, I would. I just would. The basics. SpaghettiOs. I'm a big carb... If you can't tell, I'm a big carb guy. I'd be like rice and beans, salt that shit... Or, sorry, spice that shit up and whatever, but... The shit we ate back when we were younger, right? And we're living with the guys. It's like spaghettiOs, grilled cheese. You'd be lucky if you had the weekend where you bought the big frozen pack of... Mm-hmm. You know, frozen chicken breast from Costco or Sam's. You're like, all right, I'm good for a week. Otherwise, that's what you ate. Ramen noodles. Like, my lunches, I made it this weekend. I've got a... Made a rock star chili. Ooh, that sounds good. I know, right? I got a rock star chili going. You've got an amazing chili, too. I'm a chili fanatic. Like, I would eat at 365 if I could, but Lisa, of course, hates chili. So I can only make it every now and then because the whole house is just like, oh, yeah, I'd have that aroma always, and she'd be like... Smells good. She'd be like, I'm leaving, right? But my point to... Is it like chili? Because she doesn't like beans or what? And she thinks we're weird. So we're a... For Christmas, some people do hams, turkeys, whatever. Not our family. We do chili, man. And it's a... She doesn't like it? She's like, I eat it once a year because, you know, I don't want to be rude to your mom. And it's like... We always did it. The only reason why we did that was we always spent Christmas in Glencoe, so we always went Christmas Eve. Then we always came home Christmas Day to have our Christmas in Hugo. And so we would make a chili then before we'd leave for Glencoe in a big-ass crock pot. And we'd let that shit simmer for a day and a half, literally a day and a half. And it came home, and by the time we got home at like 5, 6 p.m. on Christmas night from Glencoe, she was ready. And she was ready to rock and roll. And it was just our... It was a cool meal to make. We knew we'd be hungry by the time we came home. And it was all at the ready. Bowls were just sitting right there with the spoons and endless sleeves of saltine crackers and pull out the sour cream and the cheese with some onions. Sour cream, cheese, onions. Jen made it three weeks ago. We were like... And then the next week she made like... I was getting around like a minestrone or something like that. And then we were kind of... I was kind of souped out for a little bit. But I'm sure it's coming again. Maybe white chicken chili this time? Do you ever do that? Oh, I... See, I need like... I'll have to use her mention. I've made it, and I've liked it, and I really like white... I'm shit at making it. I don't know why. You made an unbelievable white chicken chili. Oh, it's so good. I love white chicken chili. How about chow mein? Do you like chow mein? Depends on my mood. It depends how it's made. You got my mom's chow mein. She got it from her dad. From my grandpa. So fucking good. It's like... We went... I went over... Jen and I went over there for something. Oh, I had to help my dad take a toilet off because his back was so bad. Yeah. And he was having somebody come and do the Roto-Rooter thing on Monday or whatever. This was a couple weeks ago. Oh, my gosh. It's the best fucking chow mein. Because I've had bad chow mein, too. And I'm like, yeah, this is gross. Depends on my mood. Shit, it's so good. But when it's made really well, I really like it. She puts chunks of meat, though, that are like that in there, right? I mean, they're just big... Oh. Oh. Mushroom, celery, the whole thing. Yeah. Yeah, but it's so good. And she makes it a little sweeter. I don't know what she puts in there, but man, it's good. But that's... I've always tried to explain to John that it's like... I said, this is the difference between you and I. I said... Or sorry, even for some people. I don't go hunting for the kill. I said, that's the... I go for the process. I like to hunt. Because it's hard. So that's... I like the process. We hump our asses out a mile and a half. 50-year-old men with a lot of equipment, right? And... Because we go to an area where people don't go. And that's why we bring seven of them out every damn year. You know what I mean? We found a honey hole. And it's like... But we love to hunt. And that's the process. What's cool about hunting is you get your guy time. So you get friendship time, right? Which is really important. And then you like to hunt. You know, there's a little thrill to it as well. And you get food coming out of it. And you get food coming out of it. I mean, it's just... It's great all around. I don't hunt. I've been hunting. I've hunted before. My dad hunted. I just never got into it a ton. I played so many damn sports growing up. Yeah, but you fish. Fish is the same thing. It's no different. It's no different. Same thing. If I could find pheasant hunting somewhere close, I would do it every weekend. I love walking fields. Problem is, you need a dog. And my dog would scare him away. Like, hey, stop barking at him. But, you know, I used to pheasant hunt with my dad. I love it. Duck hunting, you couldn't pay me enough money to duck hunt. That's the worst hunting ever. Four in the morning, it's rainy and cold. And then you got to go in the water and go get those ducks. And then they don't even taste very good. And you're like, I shouldn't have shot this thing. That's gross. Yeah. But it's a... But it's just a lesson that he's never understood. You know what I mean? And that's where it just, in his mind, it's just where it's warped. It's just like, if I could instill that mentality of it, John just doesn't like to work. And it's just, he want, you know what I mean? He doesn't like to work. And it's just, it's like, that's a part of using those metaphors and those other pieces. It's like, hunting is work. Fishing is work. A lot of people don't look at it that way because they enjoy it so much, but it's still work. You can't, you don't get fucking, you don't kill it every day. You have droughts and you have, it's a process. And you got to try new things and do things that are not good. And move around. And then you think about it. I wonder what else. And then you're thinking about, well, it's sunny or it's cloudy. It's wavy. It's not wavy. The water's clear. The water's dark. Same with hunting, right? Is there any food around here that the animals eat? Do I see any grass that's been knocked down? Have they been through here? You know what I mean? You're just constantly kind of thinking about, all right, what's the situation? Well, it's just, and, which he could never do. And like, can you sit there quietly for hours and not say it with only your own thoughts? Is that one of your favorite? Because one of my best buddies growing up, he's been an avid deer hunter forever, right? He's got his own land up in Princeton. And that's his favorite part. He goes, I love getting to the deer stand when it's still dark out. And I love just sitting in there. The birds all over. He's had a bear come up one time years ago. He had pictures of it. But he's like, bird, birds will like land and start eating shit. And he's just sitting there all still. And he's like, I can't look. I only shoot certain deer. So he'll be like, I'll watch the fun. He won't you to find these. I'll watch a fun go by. And, and I'll just kind of watch it for a while. Looking for, it's like, you know, dad to come through or whatever. But he absolutely loves that quiet time. There's that moment right before. I mean, it's almost instant. Also, now you can see you couldn't and all of a sudden it's just all of a sudden light emerges. And it's just a, where now you can start to see through the woods and stuff like that. And it's just like, do you have the discipline to sit there still, you know, still completely still. Um, I'm elevated. Yeah. Waiting to hear, waiting to look for the key areas. I use a tree climber stand. I do every year. And it's a, um, you know, so I'm up, I don't know. Depends on the year and depending on where I'm at. But, you know, I'm up 12, 15 feet. Maybe. Not too, you know, not nothing too bad. You ever had a bear come up? I've never seen a bear in the woods. Yeah. Yeah. He had, he heard some noises and he looked over and I can't remember what he was eating, but I think he had, he was eating something that the bear must have smelled, but he looks over and he's like, holy fuck, a fucking bear's coming up. Like, what am I going to do? And he, he said, I just, I just, still. And then I, I came up with what he did. The thing went down and left, but he was like, holy shit, he got pictures of it because he's like, look at this thing. I've only seen, um, on a, ATV trails is the only time I've ever seen bear in the wild. And then, like in Colorado, bobcats, which that like freaked me out. I was like, holy shit, because I always carry a nine millimeter on my hip in Colorado. Even though like, there's like little to note, but I just, I still don't know. And it's like, you just never know. I look like a porterhouse. Crazy. You might run into some fucking crazy guy that lives out there, right? It's, there's literally zero danger. And it's like, but it's like, I still, cause it's like, if I'm going out, man, that clip is going to be empty. I'm telling you that for sure. I know I look like a porterhouse and they'll, they'll want my chubby ass, but you know, but it's like, I'm going, if I'm going down, I'm going down swinging. That's for sure. Right. That clip is going to be empty. But it's like, we saw like, how do you want to call them? Coyotes, hyenas, whatever the hell is out there. Like there's, I can't. Coyotes. I don't think hyenas are there. No, but I mean, just that same type of predator is my point. And it's just like, um, man, they get hungry enough. You know what I mean? Jeff, like Jeff Lee talks about that. Jeff Lee talks about, yeah. Jeff Lee's talked about that where he's been stalked by a pack just running around and he's like, he's been stalking out from his place and it's like, that's, he always carries a gun. And it's like, you just don't know. Yeah. You don't know. And that's why for like, people out there who like, go out like with dogs, I wouldn't. Cause like those bastards, they're going to want the dog. You know what I mean? I would never take a dog out there. At least once a week, cause we're all woods back here. Once a week, we hear them hauling. It means they got something. They're just, and there's got, I mean, I don't know how many dogs are in this pack, but it's a big pack. And if they get, I mean, they're in the cities too. They're everywhere. But we got these nice woods, a lot of deer back here. And I don't know if they're getting deer, rabbit, what they're getting. You get an injured deer, they can easily take that down. Right. If it's been hit by a car or whatever. And hey, how old, you know, they got something. And I was, I was like, I hope they didn't get somebody's dog. Cause I know people that got their dogs taken by them too. And it's like, why would you let your dog out? Yeah. We have a fence. Well, they can jump the fence. They climb the fence. Like, why would you let your dog out unsupervised? That's my excitement, my reservation, which I've never done an Alaskan hunting trip. And I really want to do that between caribou, between whatever. Right. But that is, that is like one of those deals where you're gutting. You have other, everybody else is standing guard. The grizzlies are there. Like there's no grizzlies in Colorado anymore. I think there's, we haven't been a sighting in like, forever. I mean, they just went North pretty much. Right. I, from what I understand in terms of the climate change and whatever, but it's like, you got us. I mean, you hear those stories and that is very real. And it's like, quick, they're quick and they're going to destroy it. Yeah. Handguns not going to do anything to a grizzly. Unless you get lucky and shoot in the eye or something. Russ, um, my buddy, who's the CEO at the volumetric Alliance, he showed me a picture of a, picture once of, uh, when he worked at a Pentair years ago. Yeah. One of the executives there, he showed me a picture of a him and a gigantic fricking, what was it? A moose or an elk. I'm trying to remember now. Um, it was a big ass. Um, the hell was it? It was cause, sorry. He showed me a lot of different pictures cause they had a big trip. I think it was a moose. Um, it was, yeah, they were in Alaska. And that was the last pick. It was a moose. Yeah. If I remember right. Cause I remember just seeing the picture down. I believe, I believe that one was a moose. Cause anyway, this guy was a lifelong hunter, took Alaska trips every year, salmon fishing, hunting trips, you name it. But that was the last picture of that guy. And that while he was gutting, he was with a guide somehow, which is, this is the hole in the story. Somehow the guide lived, but he got taken by the grizzly man. He was, while he was gutting, while he was gutting, grizzly came along, killed him. Yeah. Killed him. And it was like, but the guy had lived and I'm like, something's wrong in this story, right? Either, you know what I mean? It's just like one, the fucking coward. But number one, it's like, holy shit. Or the grizzly come in. I don't know. Pipe him down, put a gash in him. Dude, I, I don't, I only heard the portion of the story other than that, that the guy died tragically, but it's, um, hopefully, hopefully it was, at least if he had a handgun, even if he didn't kill him, at least he tried to go out. Oh yeah. Oh no, he's getting nine and I'm, he may not die, but he's getting nine in the fucking head before I'm getting my ass eaten. I'm telling you that much. Or nine in the chest. Hopefully I hit, hopefully I hit the right mark, man. That's the only reason why I carry a nine on my hip out there. If I'm going down. Yeah. Go ahead. I was like, you guys got guns, right? He's like, why would we have guns? They go, uh, weirdos walking around, uh, animals, right? You got, they brought a bunch of food to cook up and I'm like, you're going to have food. Like this isn't like, you know, you're in the backyards of maple Grove here. You're like in where wild animals are. And most likely they're going to leave you alone, but you just never, if they're hungry enough, they're going to come in and you better be able to protect yourselves. So one guy had a nine millimeter. I'm like, that's not going to be any good. Who's got the shotguns? And you know, where's, all that stuff. Yeah. I'm, I'm comfortable in the wilderness. I'm comfortable in the mountains. Like the place I'm least comfortable would be like where we're going. The swamps of Louisiana, like Florida, Gators and shit. I'm like, I don't know what I'm doing out here. And I don't know anything about this life. And I don't know anything about one. I'm just like leery of it. You know what I mean? I just, I'm not, I have no experience. And I look like a rump roast and I have no experience and I have no, I'm not going to just going to go for a walk. Telling you that much big, easy, fine. But I'm just like, you know what I mean? No, that's, you know, like even Florida now with all the pythons and shit. I'm like, Oh fuck. That's just, no, that's not, Nope. Give me, give me, give me 12,000 feet in the mountain range. Yep. I'm really comfortable that, Oh fuck that shit. No. Okay. So Florida, you had to live outside for a hundred days in the swampy areas of Florida. Or Alaska. What would you choose? Oh, Alaska. I wouldn't think twice. Even though probably Florida would be safer. I had to Alaska. I wouldn't think twice. One, cause of the natural beauty too. I know what I'm doing. I just don't know anything about that life. You know what I mean? Gator wranglers. And I'm like, what the fuck? And I understand they hunt them kind of similarly, but it's like, and now like they want you to hunt Python year round. Like what? I hate snakes. You get paid. For them. But yeah, I mean, I've watched videos. We're in swampy areas and they see when they dive into swampy area. And I'm like, fuck. Cause it's not going to kill me. But what if there's a gator waiting in that swamp? And no, thanks. I'm with you. You have no prayer against a gator either. Right? Once they get their jaws locked on you, you're kind of screwed. I just, Oh my God. Like that's just, don't get me wrong. I'd love to talk to people who know what they're doing and be like, I got it. Sure. I'd be fine with it, but it's just like, uh, I don't know. Something about it. I've never watched swamp people in a show. Yeah. They don't even speak English. They got no teeth. Those are the people that hunt alligators. They got no teeth, no brains. I'm like, I'm a fire. Alligator. That's like, my brother loved that show. I'm like, dude, they got subtitles on and these are people that live in Alabama and stuff. Like what the fuck? Cause they don't speak English. Fuck. Yeah. I just, subtitles on. I'm just not familiar with that climate and that environment. Right. And it's just, it's like, fuck. I'm like, I'm with you. I'd rather be in the hills, the mountains, the open prairies, whatever, versus being in the swampy ass shit. Or in the ocean. I wouldn't want to be living in the ocean either. And there's just too much shit down there too. I'm like, I don't need that either. And it's water. Yeah. I don't know. All right, buddy. I'll get this, um, these pieces. I gotta get work done. Good to talk to you. All right. Later.
