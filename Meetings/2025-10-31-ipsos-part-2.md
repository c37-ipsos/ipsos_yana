## 📄 TRANSCRIPT

Guys, like, do we really have to tell you every two weeks? Yeah, exactly. You know, like, stay on our servers. Always review it before you use it, you know. 100%. Don't copy and paste anything in the chat, right, or anywhere else. It's all right there. Yeah. Yeah. Jake, are you on with us now? I am here with you in spirit. My absolute apologies. Teams is driving me batty this morning. They pushed another update about 2 a.m. to fix the other mess-ups from earlier in the week, and it is playing holy you-know-what, unfortunately, with my camera system, which is I only have, like, eight of them in here with the studio and everything else like that. So I've got to fix that when we're done. My sincere apologies. Yana, it's an absolute honor to meet you. Pleasure to meet you, too. So I was just, I mean, I get it. Teams is. But I also feel like every time. And then I get on a call for Zoom because I have a lot of clients who want Zoom. I'm like, oh, it's a software update. How shocking. You know? So it delays you three minutes from getting on, and you're like, please don't make me restart because we don't have time for that. Yeah. I'm almost thinking we have to move to Zoom. Yeah. Yeah. Might have to move. Yeah. We use Zoom with most of our clients and in all of our user research sessions for the most part, partially, too, because we do a lot of work with accessibility. And it's a lot more accessible tool. So if you're working with somebody who's, you know, visually impaired or hearing impaired, the accessibility features of Zoom are considerably better than Teams. Yeah. I agree. Yeah. Yep. So why don't you tell me a little bit about what you guys do? I mean, I'm obviously, I'm a UX research leader. And if you know what UX is, then you know. Yeah. You know it well. Yeah. You know it well. Good. Yeah. Yeah. So, Gianna, it is so great to meet you. And I owe Mark a call. I'm going to try to call him later today, hopefully. And I don't think Mark and I have chatted for, it's got to be at least eight years. I'll see. I used to see his kids at sporting events. Sure. Because my middle child played lacrosse and hockey and his youngest did, you know. And, well, his oldest did, too. His oldest did, too. He played in college. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I had something. He said he had left Colorado and went to the. Yeah. But he must be in the workforce now, right? Carter? Yeah. Carter is a civil engineer. Is he really? Yeah. I forgot. Yeah. Wonderful. He finished up his engineering degree last December and went to work for the company that he had interned for for a couple of years. Mark would know what the firm is. It's a firm in Minneapolis. So, yeah. Yeah. And then Zach is a licensed electrician. Yeah. So, he's working on that. And then Reed's got his contracting business. So. Oh, what's the contracting business? So, he does remodels. And. I didn't know that. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's called Lucas Builders. Okay. That's got to ring to it. Mark did the logo. Did he? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to need some of Mark's help here coming up. Because I did most of the work, Jake and I together, when we built out our original webpage. But it's time. Uh-huh. We got to get it updated. Yeah. And I know Mark's good at that. Yes, he is. Yes, he is. Cool. That is his. That's his wheelhouse. I have never done any development work. I've tried a couple of times to train myself just because I felt like it would be good. But it's not at all my skill set. Yeah. So. Yeah. Oh. You can pull it. But you can try it. Yeah. Yeah. We could show you in the vibe coding era. Now you can. Right. Well, no. I know. I have done like. Now. Now it's a lot easier to do wire frames and prototyping because if you're working on a project and then you can say to the model, now build me a wire frame for that. And it will. I mean, I'm not saying they're that good, but they will. They're better. They're still better than me. But not better than the people that I work with that do design. But it really is amazing to see what you can do. I did ask my nephew if he was going to be out of a job. Soon. But that's part of why he's moved over to AI just to make sure that he doesn't become obsolete as a software engineer. So. Yeah. Well, and Lucas is two younger kids. I mean, well, they're all in great jobs. They're going to be hard to put AI over. Exactly. Yeah. So. So brilliant. Yeah. I love it. Yeah. Well, well, Yana, it is again, it's a, it's a pleasure to meet you. Absolutely. Absolutely excited to be here chatting with you today. I'm a little bit of myself. So. So I've been in the industry for about 30 years. If you can't tell us, Jake always says, Jake has a longer beard. We're both great. Right. Started out on the engineering side of the house, moved into sales, worked with more large global companies. So I don't know if you remember Innecon, their global bar back in the day. So got my start there, then moved into various leadership roles. My last role, I spent 15 years at a company called OST. I opened up their regional office here. Okay. And we grew that office to about a hundred million a year in sales and then about 85 employees. But going back to what you and I were talking about earlier and being ready for this new era, Jake, when he goes through his overview of who he is and his background, he was with me in leadership over there. And, and we saw, and it's not, it's not a function or issue of the company, all, all companies, including the big. Consulting firms are facing this right now. Right. It's you have all this traditional, you know, expertise if you will. Right. Right. And a lot of that doesn't correlate to the new era of AI in the coming quantum era. Right. It's just, it's really hard to take a company. We are good. A lot of application development, UI, UE, right. We did traditional data center type stuff. I worked with Thomson Reuters. I worked with the company. And London Stock Exchange. So I too traveled kind of like you do, right. Yeah. All over the place. But you take that traditional knowledge set where you could hire these people and you knew you had at least five years of them to be able to use their expertise. And within those five years, they can learn the new technology that's coming out. Right. So they're always growing and always getting better. That's what was killing all of our industries was AI in this, in this coming quantum era era is moving so quickly. It's so hard to keep up. So how do you take your traditional processes, and I'm sure you're facing this internally too, and help get everybody to this new era? Well, there's not enough time, right? So Jake and I, we started Coding 37 in March of this year, and we're redefining consulting for the AI and coming quantum eras. So in the Wall Street Journal about three months ago, they talked about, there was an article where they went out and they interviewed a lot of large organizations, and one of the number one themes coming back was we're really sick of working with these consulting firms, especially the top five, who are bidding and winning projects with us, but they're learning on our dime. They don't have the expertise to say they do, right? And they're not alone. Right. So what we're doing is... We're helping organizations design, build, and operationalize intelligence systems. And what I mean by that is from AI infrastructure and data platforms, I don't know if you're familiar with Cloudera, but we're really tight with Cloudera. Okay, yep. They do the unified data platform stuff, to building custom agents, neural networks, deep learning models, and advanced AI solutions, really focused on increasing operational efficiency, boosting company performance, right, and supporting data-driven businesses. Now, how we do that... So the way we do this, we do this through our alliances. So again, looking at what we're building out here, we're sales consultants and principal architects. All of our bench is at Arrow Electronics. Are you familiar with Arrow? No. So Arrow's the largest distributor on the globe, and they have over 12,000 engineers. Oh, nice. And they work directly with 250 to 300 different partners. Okay. So all their OEM partners, like the NBIM... ...and the NBIM... ...All the non-ちら ЛС fazem корבתкаucks инженерные инженерные Who do the octopus бл Mm hm. So in short, we meet clients where they are today... Yep. ...and then we help get these up to date with the skills they need. them to where the market is heading in a fast secure and scalable way so that's kind of the 50,000 foot view Jake will get into a little bit more but I know we don't have a ton of time but it's really exciting I mean we've been talking to about 45 different organizations all I think the smallest one's about 4 billion in revenue but most of them are a lot larger than that again we come from that background and with our partnership with Arrow and Cloudera we're working together on these solutions so it's been a lot of fun and again it's an absolute pleasure to be chatting with you. Jake I'll hand it over to you. greetings from the metaverse you just have to believe or so I have to take faith that I'm real over here and this is not an AI version of me talking but no Jana it's nice to meet you I'm dr. Jake triple a co-founder and CTO of Codename 37 like Mike I've been in the industry a long time been over 30 years um um That's an unusual path to UX. I have to say. I don't think of CFO Python developer. oh yeah my path is really simple yeah three three Mike I'll give you a my path is really simple spent most of my high school career at 3m in engineering information systems while everybody else was going to school. I hung out at 3M pretty much all day, which was awesome. I got the best education ever. Grew my passion for technology there. Rose at a Fortune 50 to become a corporate controller and did that for a little bit at a time. Got really bored with finance. Then came my entrepreneurial stint, which was roughly about 15 years. Bought, started, stopped, bought, sold, you name it, multiple different entities over a broader period of time. Then my last 15, I worked for a couple other people. The Nerdery was one of them. Then that's where I met Mike at OST and Verbin from that period on. In my spare time, I finished my, through that whole journey, finished my master's and my doctoral degree on all things. My doctorate was all things artificial intelligence and automation focused. My life is probably the lamest one you're going to probably hear. I consult all day, teach all night is kind of what I tell people. I just hang out and I view consulting and teaching as kind of the same thing. My academic life, I'm also the Dean of the College of Business of Technology at Concordia University, St. Paul here in the Twin Cities. I oversee 32 programs, including also the author of our AI, data science, computer science, IT programs, then all the business programs that are your traditional MBA. Anyway, that's me in a rapid nutshell, but it's an absolute honor to meet you. I'm really looking forward to this discussion today because I'm going to be a part of your life. I'm going to be a part of your life. I'm going to be a part of your life. I'm going to be a part of your life. I'm going to be a part of your life. One, I couldn't be more excited for you as keyboard and mice go away, as we move to all things voice and touch, and you guys are going to have a blast as we get into 3D modeling and building out, I believe, spatial computing now with AI is going to be happening faster than ever. We need folks like you. You guys are going to be really, really busy. You're in the right business at the right time, in my view. It's funny because I thought that 20 years ago, and then I thought it 10 years ago. I keep thinking, when is this going to slow down? Oh, yeah. But the reality is, the tools and the core sensibility of human-computer interaction and UX, it's really transferable, right? And it doesn't get old, although we fall out of fashion. I'll tell you that. And I know that from the last year, right? A lot of people got let go at some of the biggest places. And then there was this whole, is UX dead? I was like, yeah, until the next thing that we all have to figure out together, which I think, you know, goes back to what I said earlier. Yeah. And I think that's what we were talking about at the beginning, is like, people aren't going to write prompts. No. It's just not. That is not the end point, you know? But it is so interesting, I think, right now, to figure out, like, what things are going to stick and what things are going to fall away. Yeah. Because I don't, you know, I don't think we're far enough along to know that. And I think it's like waiting for the easy button, right? Because it's got to get easier or nobody's going to do it. Although, it's interesting. I'll send you guys a link to the website. Yeah. I just want to make sure that we're going to get that right. So, you know, I've been doing POVs on AI adoption in the US, Brazil, France, Philippines, and India. Wow. Yeah. I'd love to see that. Yeah. Yeah. So, we've done AI at home. And then the one that we're releasing on Monday will be AI at work. And then the future of AI, which I just thought was funny. Everybody's already jumped to, like, I just want AI to fold my laundry. Yeah. I just want AI to, you know, like, and I'm like, yeah, you do. Of course you do. Like, this is when, you know, use cases, Mike. This is when it gets really, you know, pedal to the metal. What do you want it to do for you? People, you know, had really good ideas. But I'm like, you know, I don't, I'm guessing the engineers aren't thinking that, you know, about that stuff that people have to do every day, right? Because that's when, you know, as long as it's all of us just thinking about it and building it. Yeah. And building big data centers. I don't think, you know, ROI doesn't happen, right? I mean, for us, we're doing two things. We're doing AI for our clients and trying to help them understand how to implement AI in research. But then we're also doing it for ourselves. When I was talking about, you know, trying to build the series of something that will make the ROI more obvious. I think the nice thing for us is the ROI does seem pretty clear to me in my space. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because, you know, we used to have to watch a hundred videos. If you don't have to watch a hundred videos anymore, like, you know, it's a game changer for us. We can do quant— 100% of this. Yeah. We can do quant, scale, qualitative research in, you know, five markets— Yeah. —in a matter of a week. Yeah. Where, where that used to be, you know, getting out and, and setting up field spaces and having people come in. I mean, even, you know, remote… we do a lot of remote interviewing but it's nothing like being able to do this stuff with ai moderation it's it's crazy that works perfect right what a perfect use case right there yeah no it is i mean i've been we we luckily we just i don't know if you know outset ai i mean they're just one of a million companies in the bay but um we just started a partnership with them on ai moderation because to you know we can't keep up moving you can't move fast enough you know and by the time you get 19 000 people on board to use a tool the tool changes those absolutely yeah yeah so yeah i think that is going to be i mean i see it as one of our biggest problems but but it's also interesting what you'll see in this povs like the adoption rates in brazil and india are you know way higher than the u.s and france because they just see like they kind of see the happy rosy side of it right that it's just freeing up so much time for them in ways that they haven't been able to access before because they didn't have the capital to automate and now it's just like they get to leap over it just the same way asia leapt over the laptop and went straight to mobile yeah yeah it's interesting because at with claudera the partnership we have yeah we have smoothly their fastest home region is down there right absolutely and so unifying data is so crucial yep when you're doing anything ai right you want to have access for the right data sets all the data sets yeah right so that information is is real and tangible and they're i mean they're going gangbusters down there unifying their data it's just amazing yeah yeah well i think that the the for them the trade-off is so clear um whereas for us i think we're still i don't know i think for one we're just a little bit risk averse but we also do have more riding on it right i mean yeah uh i just um you know i watched my brazilian team do stuff that i'm like oh my god like you're terrifying me guys but their clients are in you know their clients like let's pilot this let's do it let's try it so i try to stay out of their way um because then we can learn from them right yeah and then we can learn from them and then we can learn from people in their field but it's just not gonna help us if we don't do it and then we can help people there so just that would be how it works exactly and then we can utilize you know the high- efficacy and maybe were take advantage of helping to navigate their behavior and safety that would be something that could there could be a ich and the situation and if the aspects simply don't create going back right just getting activity my kidsпarFor motor or transportation going back that's something else the the way i think you can Each phone is important when you do it even邍we can we can learn why it's important in this relationship? through, you know, they've built some agents to help their employees, so agents under your employees, right, help build them up so they're more productive and can move faster. So that's one thing. And there's some other areas where they're testing things out. Did you want to just start high level, Jake, and then kind of work down from there? I'd be happy to. Just another clarifying question for you again. Jana, what would be the most helpful thing I could offer you today? I told you what would be the most helpful in terms of information as you look at your business as a whole or your operation or whatever the case may be, because this is such a big topic and I just want to make sure I'm not wasting your time. Well, I think one of the things that we were talking about too is for me, I don't like, I don't really care what happens behind the scenes. I want to know like what are the use cases we can apply things to, right? Where are things going quickly that we should be thinking about? Like AI moderation, right? I didn't think about that until about a year and a half ago, but the people that I'm working with were thinking about it three years ago. Like what are the things that, what are the things that are coming that might be relevant, I think, for a large research organization and a global organization? Because my people are everywhere. Yeah. And is this stuff, I mean, the thing that, and this one, you could correct me if I'm wrong, but I feel like I thought there was going to be a problem with bandwidth and data processing that was going to make this, these tools less relevant for Brazil and Southeast Asia. And I'm, I'm not feeling that yet. So like, why is that? Because I thought that would be a problem. And is that going to change? Great question. Great question. So I think it's use cases and like, is the global thing going to work evenly at the rate of adoption that people want it? Yep. Are we going to find my, you know, certain teams bottlenecked? Gotcha. Last clarifying question, then I'll go on a, hopefully a useful screed for you, if you will. Can you tell me in your operation, the types of model you've met? If I remember right, when I was throwing things at my system for not working, I thought I heard you mention that you had developed your own internal AI capabilities and systems. And it sounds like you have, you're using a lot of models locally. Is it mainly LLMs? Or are you using other like machine learning, deep learning, neural networking type capabilities? Or is it mainly just large language models? For us, it's mostly LLMs. As far as I know, like, but I'm not the person who builds the stuff. Sure. You know, we've been, we've, what they originally gave us was basically a, you know, a chat that we could access eight of the models. Yep. Yep. So we were kind of, we try to be more agnostic. Yep. More recently, we've been granted, my team's been granted various licenses so that we can try things. And we've found the most usable one that we can actually get something out of quickly. Yeah. It's Gemini. Gemini 2.5 Pro with the gems, because we are building a lot of gems. Yep. Because I don't, you know, because, I'm a smaller service line. We have 17 lines of business. I'm a smaller one. So I got to do stuff myself, right? Kind of the vibe coding thing. And I've just said, like, could you guys just like stay out of my way and let me use the tools? Sure. So that my team can build an experiment and not have to go through the, just the process of being in the, in the queue for IT, you know? Yep. For one, my people all know product development. They work, like that's what they, that's who they work with all day long, right? So they get how to build stuff. But it, but it needs to be easy enough. So that's where we've been hanging out and, and then hoping for someone to support us with, you know, stuff at a higher level so that we're not creating, you know, I've just said, like, researchers can't manage 20 gems. They can manage one or two, you know, like an internal one and an external one or something. Sure. Like, it has to be easy. So how do we, you know, get to, again, get to the easy button more quickly? Totally. So I'm curious, like, what can we skip? You know? Yeah. That's where I really would like to skip some of this, but I don't even know where I skip to. So that's, obviously, it's a bigger question. I will. All of us, maybe. Yeah, no, great question. So I will paint the, I think I, if I remember right, when this thing, I think Mike kind of got into, you know, why code. Yeah. Code name 37. I'll just emphasize one key area of Mike's topic on that and why we built our model around this. And I think he went in through all the details with you, if I heard correctly, why we skipped to this model and why we view that the traditional consulting model is deader than a doornail. Yep. And why we did this. But anyway, so I'll paint a quick future for you. Then I promise I'll backtrack and I'll get you some value, hopefully. Hopefully. I view your industry one, same way, not, not a similar to ours. So you're, you're also talking to a company that already has just over 30 AI employees. There's a variety of different ways. You call them gems today, right? There's lots of different cool things that you can do, right? And GPTs and so on. Here's the difference. And here's, and so here's, here's the evolution of what's going to occur in your industry. Soon, if you haven't already, you're going to fundamentally. Experience and realize the limitations of LLMs, which are, there are many. And you and your organization will become probably, I wouldn't be surprised in the next five years, probably 50% AI agents and bots versus people, probably a 50, 50 mix or, or even further, depending on the circumstances. I view the future consultant, future UXer is a rockstar person surrounded by lots of AI capability. Exactly. Not all of them. Not, not just tools, not just those other pieces, but a combination of agents and intelligence agents for all these different pieces. Here's the, here's the rub in terms of, and I'm going to put all these things together at one time. Your industry will be defined by its use of machine learning models, deep learning, neural network, and transformers, especially for your qualitative side of that world, not LLMs. LLMs will become the minor part of your world. Yep. Because your, um, I love working. I so love working with you extras because I just don't have your skillset, right? You see different things than I do and it's awesome. And you're between your processes, the models that you're using, your workflows, whatnot. You have so much intellectual property because I've never met a UX firm that does, um, things the exact same way. The philosophies might be the same, but the way they go about it and their minds, the, how they go. I mean, there's, there's just differences. I've never met one that's exactly the same, which I think is super cool. And that to me is your intellectual property, but that can now all be built in what I'll call the intelligence layer of your institution. Yep. Where in real time, this is what's going to make your agents smarter, not gems. Right. Um, the LLMs are not gonna, they serve their purpose and they will continue to get smarter. We'll continue to evolve them. The big companies, cause they can afford to do it. We'll bring it out to probably 50 trillion parameters here before long and it's going to be great. There's going to be a lot of value to that. Yeah. Yeah. So, um, pattern recognition is connections between the dots and in the, and in your world that is machine learning for the pattern recognition, but then deep learning and neural networks, those types of deep learning models is your wheelhouse completely. So if I was, if I was advising you somehow, I'd be like, get going on the path, continue down the LLM train, but your real value, how you're going to dust your competitors is in the deep learning machine learning side. Right. Right. Right. So, um, you're going to be with transformers, which are essentially just many deep learning models. If you're not familiar where you get to take your ideas and your brains and then turn them into code and be like, this is how we make connections. This is what we're, you know, we're basically training those models over a variety of different data sets over time. And on top of all that, building a system, which currently, um, your current system, even though Google's claiming that it does, it's, it's incredibly limited. Um, building your own system. Yeah. Um, building a system that is persistent, that is constantly learning over time, that remembers everything that, so having that, what I'll, I blended all that together. That's the intelligence layer, but that is how your future agents will be smart because it will access that intelligence layer always on your behalf. And that's how you'll achieve your internal automation capability, if you will. And that's how you, that's how we get to truly being agentic. Yeah. If that makes sense. No, it does. I mean, that's one of the questions that we've kind of, you know, we've been talking about. Um, so I think that's, I think that's a great question. Um, so I think that's a great question. Is do we train things on our IP or on our, on our frameworks, or do we train them on the outcomes? That makes sense. Like we have the whole set of ways that we go into research and do, but then we also have, this is what the successful thing looks like, which we, we found that AI likes to see the successful output. Right. Because that's kind of where it. It's learning what's the right way and the wrong way, because there's a lot of space in between those two things, right? Between a framework and how you do it to actually a good product. But the fundamental flaw of LLMs in your world today is you UXers understand how to create knowledge. Uh-huh. AI does not. AI understands the patterns of the data set that it's actively looking at in the system. Yep. And then through some fun mathematics and everything else like that. I wish I had my board. I draw some out for you, but anyway, through some fun mathematics and through some statistical, um, um, magic, I mean, yeah, we're having, and through some, and through the magic of transformers, truly, um, we're getting some cool outputs. However, your process is very different for how you create knowledge. It's, um, in some UXers, it's the scientific process, other UXers, it's a whole different types of workflows, but you're creating knowledge very differently. That's where I view as LLM. Right. Uh, and so, uh, I think that's, uh, one of the things that's really interesting is that, uh, you know, you're creating knowledge, but you're creating knowledge for yourself. Because it'll, it'll play a role, summary, other different types of pieces and stuff like that. But your whole structure for how you get to that outcome is very, is wildly different and a different, frankly, mathematical model. Yep. But however, hidden in your processes is, frankly, the mathematics for how, I would argue, your intellectual property for how you'll end up creating your own. And to Mike's point in terms of however, if we're a fit or how potentially we could partner, we'd show you how to create your own. Right. And the, the part of that is, and you're also talking to an infrastructure expert, the challenge you're going to have as you're, as internally as you build all this capability, companies don't understand what's coming in terms of the AI infrastructure that has to be in place for all this stuff to work. Yeah. You know what I mean? For it to work well. Totally. I get that. And the demands for compute, the demands for, um, storage are just going to explode, especially in your world, especially for the research, life science space. I mean, I pick it. I pick and choose it. Right. But a robust infrastructure where in your world, especially with your scale and the size of your company, you're going to be training, or should be actually, uh, 50 to a hundred models at a time with your new ideas, with your new insights. And always because models go bad over time. And that's one of the operational challenges that most companies are not ready for is hundreds and thousands of models in production at any one time. Right. That are driving agents, driving. Right. Designed for specific workflows and things of that nature. All that is processing power. We're kind of all spoiled based on what we're currently using today, but that's all built on multi-billion dollar infrastructure that people don't have. Right. But as we, as people want to do things on their own, all those things have to be in place, but that's, I don't know if this is helpful, but that's how I view your, I view your space very clearly. And if I was a part of your firm, I'd be like, we gotta do this because that's, it's your bread and butter and your, uh, your core IP. Right. And we do have, right. We have a ton of IP and years of data that makes models already. Right. But so when you say like the difference will be from moving from LLMs to deep learning, I don't know what deep learning is. Yeah. No, no worries. In your, in your world, it's, um, um, sorry, what am I, I'm sorry. What do you call that favorite exercise when we're categorizing cataloging? So you're in a meeting and all of a sudden everybody does the post-it note exercise, right? Information architecture. Right. Sure. Right. Yeah. I'm sorry. It's been a while since I've been involved in UX projects. I can't remember the technical term, but anyway, as you're, as you're working on your information architecture, as you're cataloging and categorizing data, you're finding the common themes across those things. That's what deep learning does in microseconds across massive amounts of data sets. Machine learning recognizes the pattern. Deep learning is how we start to put them all together. Okay. Is that helpful? Yep. But with your guidance, with your, um, with your expertise, with your company's knowledge, you would be creating and developing wow, deep learning models with, with your secret sauce. You know what I mean? And there's starting points where you're not starting from scratch. You're starting from, you know, some general open source models out there, but the value for your organization would be, we're going to enhance it. Right. We're going to stick our 30% of our intellectual property on top. And we want to look at data and insights and whether it's survey data, whether it's other research, whatever it is. Right. And bring all those things together. The second part of this, then with that capability, with those models is then you're, you're getting into designing really special types of agents and bots that are like, hello, AI bot researcher team. You're my assistant and you know exactly what I'm looking for. And, oh, by the way, we just. We just did a similar project like this a year ago that the system knows and remembers because you have the infrastructure to do that. And it's like, oh, yeah, I know exactly what you're looking for. I'll get back to you in 10 minutes. Yeah. You know, bam, out it comes. That's, that's your future operation. And do you think that, that in the end, what that does is, I mean, we talk a lot about synthetic data. Do you think it becomes a synthetic data solution or do you still use humans? I mean. Great question. I, I view that's going to be your core value proposition in this era, which is going to be for some, they're going to try to do, some are going to try to do everything you do just through pure automation, but they're going to be missing something critical. They didn't talk to anyone. Yeah. Yeah. That's, that's. Thank you. You know, no. My feeling. Exactly. Yeah. Discussions that I'm having with the people, the people that I like that are building platforms in our space is a recognition that. Yeah. Humans are still humans and for innovation, it's hard to, I mean, you can get some innovation out of the past, right? But you've got to have people projecting into the future about things. AI, AI cannot answer. How, how can we say let's, let's go to some scholarly theory real quick, shall we? I mean, I'm, I'm speaking in your, in your world, right? Yeah. Sorry. Most people are constructivist and interpretivist. Right? Yeah. Our realities are constantly changed because all of our experiences, all the things that define us, we all come from this different place and it shapes our reality. Yeah. The nice way of saying it, we're complicated and we're complicated and that is a constant ever dynamic thing of, of humanity. And that's what I really value so much about UX is that we're going to do this process and our value is we're going to capture this in this period of time. Yeah. Then on your qualitative side of your world. Yeah. I'm sorry for the, I, I, I'm a quant, but also I'm a big, I'm a big, I'm a big qualitative person. I can't predict, I can't predict the future in all my, I love the quant. I love numbers. I can't predict the future looking at the past. I can tell you the pattern. I can tell you the trends. I can't predict the future without the qualitative side. That's where you guys come in. And that's where your model development in this space, doing some of these pieces, recognizing these patterns, combine, combine. Work with elements of statistical probability, but your way in terms of how you look at it is such huge value. But I mean, your, we're never going to stop talking to people. That's not going to happen and that's always going to be the true value. I can sit and build you the most ridiculous models and capabilities and whatnot. Will I be able to match your ability to be like, so do you all like this or not? No. Oh okay. That tells me more. Doesn't work the way you expected it? Exactly. Yeah. no the engineers didn't quite get it yeah yeah yep your industry is so awesome we so take it for granted now because everything just works it's like how do you think we did that it wasn't an engineer sorry it was not an engineer doing that it was a uxer right yeah well that's so then what do you think about because you you did mention processing power yeah and so how do you think that plays out globally great question the current models that are existing between the cloud and you name it are going to do not scale and are completely unaffordable for multiple different sizes of businesses and so companies will kind of be forced to make that calculation what can we do on our own within reason the answer for you know companies of you know i'm gonna like 50 million 100 million yeah billion their needs are all going to be different but i mean there's only one certain type of company that can afford the multi-billion dollar architecture to build massive large language models and most companies aren't going to do with that but they're going to learn here if they're not learning already i think the mit study recently was case in point on why most um well most um ai projects are struggling most pocs are failing people are realizing the limitations of llms there's there's some awesome some use cases incredible use cases but they are not the use case for absolutely everything and they're kind of being positioned that way and so companies they're kind of what i'm talking about here of like wow we need very small HabacLearn wife education or what i've been that goes very specific models that does very specific things i call it ike the concept they use is like it's like the snapshots we have these very specific tools to do these very specific jobs pauli it on to be any different and the upaanbhe them organizations will be managing these things our regulations that they're going to managin they'll grab open source ones and try them out a little bit and do some things on their own. But that's where the real value is going to come. That's how we achieve this highly automated, highly intelligent, all data-driven, combined with rock star experiences future that we're all trying to create. Yeah, it sort of sounds like the problem of AI scaling, right? The idea that the more specific you are with AI and the more focused you put it on a single task, the better it does. It sounds like that, like reality scales. Well, the challenge, so given what you have, and I don't know your organization probably either has an enterprise subscription or like typically, right, with Google or ChatGPT, and you might even develop solutions that are calling their APIs and things of that nature. It's affordable. It's affordable today, but that's going to change. Yeah. It's really, really expensive to run these things. And I think I believe in the midst of rebooting and everything else like that, I think you all mentioned too, there's an unaffordability, there's an ROI that they're going to want back, right? All these trillions of dollars that are being spent. And so this business model is going to be changing. It's going to be changing rapidly. Yeah, that's an interesting thing, right, to think about. Because I was just reading, the Times had the article this morning about how much money is being invested and that the big ones are paying for it with profit right now, right, off advertising, obviously. But yeah, is that sustainable or are they burning through cash that they have now that they're not going to earn as quickly as they're spending? I believe this is a, yeah, this is the amped up version of, I mean, Amazon lost money for what was it, 12, 13 years? Netflix lost money for its first, oh, what was it, seven or eight? Until they figure out how to monetize. Yep, this is the amped up version. This is the really amped up, amped up version of that, if you will. The challenge is, unfortunately, the challenge is it's all going to be paid for by the destruction and reinvention of industry. That's where the real money is. That's where they're after. That's where the payoff will become. Because if you can, for example, I don't think any of us who are now getting our first look at, shall we say, healthcare insurance for 2026 and crying in some cases on the increases, would anyone be opposed for a 80% reduction in generalized medicine that is more diagnosis-based and AI-bot-based that's pretty much 97% accurate for, you know what I mean, things of that nature? Would anyone object? Probably not. My world of higher education, would anybody oppose an education for $10,000 a year versus, for some institutions, $125,000 a year? Yeah. No one's going to say no to that. That reality is coming for many industries, and that's how they intend to pay for it. Go ahead. Well, then I think you just, you know, having seen the 14,000 layoffs at Amazon on Wednesday and knowing people impacted, I do start to wonder, what are we going to do with all the humans? Yeah. Great question. I think it's problematic. And, you know, this isn't from like an anti-capitalist view. It's literally like the logistics of how do you redeploy 14,000 people? Yep. Well, there's that. How will we redeploy 10,000 or, you know, 8,000 of our employees? Yeah. I view this as a temporary issue, and I'll tell you why. The data is very, very clear that, unfortunately, because of the cost of living, our birth rates, and birth rates across the world are declining dramatically. I mean, crashing. It is where we are pretty much going to become Japan in the 80s and the 90s. Yeah. We do not have enough people for a $30, $40, $50 trillion economy. And not unlike Japan in the 90s, who went purely to robotics, automation, because they were dealing with this problem. We're trying to plug this problem with automation and artificial intelligence technologies. Yeah. I think this is really... Yeah. Yeah. I think this is going to be really... There's going to be, unfortunately, a lot of pain as this transition happens. I agree. I'm arguing we need an education renaissance, which is why I do what I do to try to help as many... Reskill as many people as we can. And as fast as we can. But I think it's going to be very short-lived, if you will. And when we're going to come to the problem is... Then we're going to come down to the problem of, did automation actually help us as much as we need? And then how bad is the lack of people problem? Because again, we just had... We're at about... This is the... These next year or three, actually, I think, if my math is correct. This is the last of the boomer generation that's going to be in the workplace now. I mean, they're going to be gone. And I'm full disclosure, I think Mike told you I was old and gray. I'm a Gen X-er, full disclosure. And our generation is kind of scrunched in the middle, if you will. But there's just not enough people. Right. Right. The problem is going to be short-lived. The question is, how do we retrain everybody? Well, yeah. I think that's also... In my mind, it's... It is... I mean, I felt that way when I was... I owned my own agency for eight years. And trying to get UX-ers. You know? Yeah. I was just like, the schools are not turning out the people I own. No. And I'm not optimistic that they will now either. I don't know. It's a great question. And is there willingness, right? Because there was just another article about... There was a article about coal this morning in the Times. And I was like, really? Are we still talking about that? Like, why are these people not in robotics now? Right? I mean... Right. Yeah. I have a colleague who's a Chinese national. And when she was home for Spring Festival last year, she said they demonstrated their robots as dancers at the Spring Festival events. And she said that the first place that they're trying to deploy them is as home health care aides. And I thought, yeah. Right? I mean... Wow. Because they've got the problem. They've got the problem of single-kid families. Right. Nauseam, right? For the next, who knows, what, 30 years? Caring for their elderly. So, yeah. So, that's what they're... Yeah. They're doing robots for home health care. Yep. Which is, you know, like, it's great. But you've got to have people to build the robots. And I feel like the U.S. is just not retooling their education system. We are not. I act like it's somebody else. You know, because for a while, I opened up a... I opened up a... A UX-like boot camp training thing. And, you know, we could train people. But there's kind of a lack of interest or willingness for a lot of people to learn anything new. It's not our... I don't know. I feel like it's not the most common skill set these days. A speech I give often, unfortunately, these days... I was just in New York recently at a conference giving this similar speech. I mean, people have to remember that AI is an accelerator. I believe we're going to create... If we do it right, we'll create more geniuses than any other time in history. However, there's also... That's people who want to really want to learn, really want to apply themselves, and so on. However, it's also an accelerator for the bad of people who don't want to do nothing. And I fear what's to come. I hope people choose the genius route and really want to grow. I fear many will not. And those are the folks that are going to have a really tough time. And I... I get asked this question a lot. You know, when's AI going to take my job? It's like... Actually, I have a totally different view. I said, AI is not going to take your job. I said, it's someone with my skill set who's going to take your job. Yeah. It's folks who... People who are enabled by these skills and capabilities. That's who you're afraid of, not just AI. Well, yeah. That's, you know, one of the points that came out of our research was all these tensions with AI. But the top one is job displacement versus productivity. Yep. Because it's sort of like the economy is horrible, but my economy is good. There's a lot of AI makes me so much more productive, but it's going to take my job. Like, how do I live with those two things? Well said. Yeah. And it was the top tension that we found in this research. And I think... But, you know, that question is coming from people who are the enthusiastic ones, right? Because the tension that they see is AI is helping me so much. How do I prevent it from taking my job when I can see how it's going to displace people? And, you know, the question that we get a lot in research is if you end up using AI as your research assistant and you're not training juniors, how do you get the next generation of younger people that know how to do what you do? It's like the electricians and the plumbers, right? Exactly. And getting back to that. Or nurses even, right? Yeah. Yeah. People educating nurses. 100%. Yeah. Top. You're spot on. So a lot of the organizations that Jake and I have been talking to, if you talk to IT, IT's frozen, right? Yeah. They don't know where the future is going or where they're going to take it, right? Right. They also don't know if they're going to have a job. Right. So they're frozen. They're not making decisions. Right. They're not doing a whole lot. We spend most of our time on the lines of business. Yeah. These are the people saying... How do we automate and work more efficiently? And when we're having those conversations, it's never around reducing the workforce, right? Right. It's about enabling their workforce to do more important things, right? And there's a lot of the workforce, and I'm sure you guys are no different at your company. People are working so many different jobs inside their company, and there's not enough hours in the day to do all that. Yeah. You know, that's what we're looking to automate those features and functions that you can. And allow your people that you're paying really, really good salaries to do more meaningful work. Yeah. Right? But you're... I mean, what you're saying is we're seeing this... This year has been a year of nothing, is what Jake and I say, meaning a lot of companies are going, we don't know what the future brings, we don't know where to go, we're frozen. Right? We absolutely... We don't have any budget. We have seen that. We have absolutely seen that, that people just cannot take a step forward. Yes. It's really interesting. Yeah. I was surprised. I was at a leadership dinner for UX folks in New York, and we went around the table, and like, who's using AI in their research? And these leaders from companies that I think of as very, like, innovative, were like, no, we haven't gotten permission yet. Are you kidding me? Yeah. Right? Wow. That just seems so short-sighted. Right? It does. But especially, like, you know, thinking about highly regulated... Yeah. Industries like healthcare and financial services, where there's this huge opportunity, they also have the most conservative, risk-averse, you know, compliance and legal teams and IT teams, I think, because... And as a result, they're getting turned down. The businesses are getting turned down all the time for things that they want to do. And, you know, it's really... I agree. I've seen it freezing entire, you know, companies, and I'm thinking, you know, why are you not? Why are you not doing this? I get that there's risk, but, man, there's a lot of ways to mitigate the risk. That, like, you don't have to be frozen, but... But here's some... You know, we're just seeing our biggest clients that have to build this stuff are moving. But even they took, like, a six-month break to think about it. And then they laid everybody off, and now they're, you know, redeploying people. Yes. What's up? Maybe I would love to hear if you're... I would love to hear if you're already doing this, Yana. Because one of the things that we're going to have to resolve is what in the world does the future institution look like? What's the employee experience going to be? Right. What is it? I mean, so is my life going to be... My life is already connected all the time. I'm already doing three jobs, but it looks like now I'm going to be doing seven. Okay. Yeah. And you're supposed to be surrounding me with all this capability that's going to be helping do all this stuff. All right. I'm kind of down, but I'm kind of bummed. It seems like I'm going to be working all the time with no end in sight. And it's... But at the same time, to align with that question, it's that I think your skill sets, your organization's type of work, these companies are making a massive mistake. You already mentioned not hiring the younger generation. What are you going to do? Do you honestly believe that bots are just going to solve all these problems? You guys haven't even figured out how this stuff works yet. And you're talking to someone who builds all this stuff for a living. It's complicated. Yeah. Yeah. We don't have a GenTik systems yet. We're not there. We're getting there, but we're not there. Right. And it's like... And just to believe that miraculously all these things are going to appear and their operations are going to be rocking and rolling, it's not going to... This is going to take time. Well, and I think that ROI conversation, I keep thinking, like, give us a little time. Right? Like, to your point, there's not a ton of support. I mean, there may be... There may be three people, I feel like, in my organization who really get it and that I can go to to ask for help. Yeah. But a lot of it is me grabbing the smart people. I mean, there are a lot of smart people. But the smart, curious people from my teams and being like, will you please try this? Let me know how it goes, how I can fix it, what else we could do with it, and letting them go. You know? Yeah. Which seems... Like, I guess it's good, but it seems... I wish there was... I wish there were more smart people that were curious. Because, you know, then you have the whole smart people that are super resistant. And that doesn't help us get to the answers any quicker. That's an area where we've been helping. Okay. Because that's where we come in, and not only across our services, but as consultants, right? But that's the part where the education comes in. People I have found through not just professionals, but also students, that's where my data set's coming from. Yeah. People just have to... People just have to experience it. And then something happens, typically about in the first 35 minutes. They're like, oh my God, I just didn't know. Right. I had no idea. And I didn't... And we have to be prepared in all of our worlds where... I'm going to use a metaphor of positionless basketball, if you will. But imagine employees like yourself and all of your teams around the world where anyone can do anything. Because that's what's happening. That's what's going to come. And it's super cool for a business. And it's super cool in terms of the things you're going to be able to do. But we haven't figured out yet. Wait a minute. That goes against all things organizational theory, organizational design. It goes against our hierarchies, our bureaucracies. And it's like, how is this going to work? And all things to figure out, which are exciting times for your business. But anyway, that's a big part of some of our work in terms of our workshops is education. Which is... Here's what's... We can't stop it. But here's what's coming. And here's how we can help prepare you. Not just closing in terms of skills gaps. But giving people experience. And then it just unleashes a creativity where it's like, okay, now get out of my way. And it's like, exactly. Here, we'll hold the door open for you. Rock on. Right? Yeah. Well, that's where I've had the most success. Yeah. I mean, that's how we're getting to answers most quickly is just to let people that are passionate about it. And understand enough. Understand the guardrails. That they're... Producing. But that's not coming from my classic resources. You know? That is not... It's not coming from my IT team. It's coming from my researchers. And designers. Right? People that are looking to solve a problem in their own daily life. Not surprised, right? Yeah. You know? And then I think the other thing... We looked at white space. How people are using AI. And the white space is an automating, repetitive... And boring tasks. And we're like, dude, that seems... Like, why would that not be where people are using it? Right? But that... It's an interesting thing to consider that that really hasn't caught on. You know? Except for coding. I think we haven't really seen... But probably part of that is we don't have the people to build the stuff yet. Enough. Right? I mean... I don't feel like I'd know who to call. My nephew. Yeah. So, I guess... I'm going to say your world. But, I mean... Because I'm so excited for your world in the next five years. When spatial computing becomes the thing. And it will. Yeah. Because the difference is this time... I've been, as a child... I mean, I've been waiting for virtual reality forever. The reality is it's just... Why it's never come to be. It's just way too expensive. Right. Like, even for the gaming world. If you're... I don't know if you have children. I have three. My children got really into the game Fortnite. If you're aware of that phenomenon. That trend. Yep. And it drove me crazy at the time. But, I mean... People don't know. It cost $100 million in terms of UXers. They have one of the largest UX teams on the planet to build that 3D world. Yeah. And to... But it was a $100 million investment. Well, that's not practical. And the reason why a lot of people are asking... Why did Mark Zuckerberg spend $1 billion on X number of people? Go look at their doctoral research. And it's all about us. Stitching together. Sorry. Transforming us from 2D models to 3D models and absolutely everything. That includes artificial intelligence 3D models. The difference between back then versus when Mark launched the metaverse or wanted to launch the metaverse versus today. Now he has AI. And now he can do it at 90% less cost. And now he has it. So, a billion dollars of people are like, what is he doing? It's actually for him. It's a no-brainer because no one else can compete with him in this space. Yeah. Yeah. And... But that... Yeah. Because, I mean, we consistently in the research that we do in AR, VR, it's all about dissatisfaction on the part of the user with the slow processing times. The hardware is not up to speed. And a realization, I think, that it might not get there. So, I think there's that kind of, why will I keep doing this if they can't get the software? Yeah. And hardware up to where I want it to be because I keep getting all these jitters and lags. But that's... Yep. And that kind of thing. But that's going to become the aha moment for everyone. Yeah. Is that... Because... Well, I think equipment will keep getting cheaper over time. And the processors will keep getting more powerful. But that's where people are going to decide, well, can I have a more efficient model to help me do these things? And that kind of goes back to probably a half an hour ago in our conversation. You're going to have the expertise. Expertise and abilities. And people like us can show you, oh, I can make a much more efficient model that can run on my existing hardware. And actually, it works out pretty well. And where I can get the most bang for the buck without having to continually spend all my capital, all of our profits to continually do this stuff. Right now, tech has to. They don't have a choice because we're trying to defeat China and the rest of the world and own this space. And that's the game is on, right? For businesses. It's like, well, there's highly efficient ways. And that was if there's one good thing, despite the terrible outcome of what deep seek phenomenon, if you're familiar. But don't get me wrong. They cheated. And that was unfortunately the thing. But the whole idea was the claim was still the right one. How can you do it more efficiently? And how can the model use less energy, require less processing power, but be just as efficient? That's the game. And for folks like you, it is sorry for all of us, smaller micro focused models that are very specific, that do very specific things. Yep. That's the key. And that's a part of if you feel we're a fit, these are what our engagements look like. We can show we can advise on how to do these things. We can help build these things. We can put in the infrastructure to kind of do those things. But that's the company we built. I think it's. That's great. So, yeah, we went pretty far over. My apologies. That's my job. But I was enjoying the conversation. I appreciate you guys spending the time. Because, yeah, it's, you know, there aren't a ton of people that want to have these conversations, aside from my nephew in my life. So my cat surely doesn't understand it. So if it would make his feeder feed him more. Maybe the model would be. Yeah. But in the meantime, yeah, it's it's good to automate the feeder. And then, you know, well, it is automated. It just doesn't happen often enough. You know, so he sits like, yeah, at about eleven twenty five, he'll start sitting by it. I'm like, you got an hour to wait. And you know that. Right. Because it happens the same time every day. He's like, I don't want to miss it. So, yeah. But this has been super. Super helpful. Just even kind of helping me think about what we, you know, what we're doing versus what we could be doing, I think, is where. But there's there are a couple of people in my organization I'd like to talk to. And maybe we could expand the circle for, you know, another discussion. Yeah, I would be honored by that. Yeah. And one other thing we could do, Jan, is we could take once Jake reboots all the systems. Maybe. Yeah. Early next week, we can put together a video for you. Just kind of lightboarding out all the stuff we've talked about or the vision. Yeah. We see. And maybe some use cases. And we can send that to you. And that's something you can take a look at. Yeah. And if you see value in it, you feel free to send it along to some of your colleagues. But would that be helpful for you? That would be very helpful. Yeah, it would be. Because I think my notes are not visual. And more people are visual learners. But this is how I learned to write it down. And there was something else I was thinking when you said that. Apologies. I can't remember now. Things come quickly and they go even quicker. Yeah. Sad. Oh, yeah. No. And I will send over the two POVs that we've done so far. The reason I think they're pretty interesting is because they're global. Right. And there are very definitely cultural differences that we're seeing in adoption and usage. Sure. So I think it would be worthwhile for you guys. Love to see that. Love to see it. Yeah. Thank you for that. Yeah. And Jake, are you going to be at the AI Summit in New York? Do you know about that event? I will not. The upcoming one. I believe I know which one. It's in December 3rd and 4th or 13th and 14th. If we're talking about the... I don't know. We just have some clients coming for it. And I'm going. So I didn't know if you were going to be there. Which conference by chance? Sorry. All I know it's called is the AI Summit. If we're talking about the same one, I did turn down a speaking engagement at that one. Or sorry, possibly if we're talking about the same one, which I do not know. But it... 10th and 11th at the Javits Center. Yeah. No, right now, my apologies. I just was at an event in New York just recently. But no, I'm not planning on being in December. But I'll actually look if I'm thinking of the same one. But no, I'm not planning to be over there in December, unfortunately. Well, maybe you can keep me posted if you're in the city presenting on anything. Love to. And we also have... Yeah, that one. Is it this one? Okay. Yeah, we can take a look at it. We're down in New Orleans. New Orleans in two weeks. And Jake's going to talk track down there. But that's for Aero's Technology Summit. Got it. So all the OEMs in the space will be down there, which is kind of cool. And this will be the first time that I've gone to this one. But I had some clients who do a lot in the space asking me if I would be there. So I'm like, it's local. Sure, I'll be there. How nice is that, right? Yeah. Yeah, it is nice. But we do also have a presence in San Francisco and Chicago. So similarly, if there... There are things going on that we should be connecting or being at to learn, it would be great to know. Because it's hard to know what's a credible event and what's a waste of time. I mean, it's always been that way with UX, right? Yes. And metaverse stuff. And so, yeah, this will be the same. It's trying to figure out who's speaking with credibility and authority and who's making money off of it, right? Yes. Yes. Yes. I guess we can all make money off of it, but providing value is how I should have phrased that. No, you're spot on. Some people do it for the money, and then you get the talk track, and you're like, we'll sit there and listen. We're like, no, that doesn't count. Right. Yeah. Yeah. But others, we've been to some that have been just phenomenal, especially the ones Jake speaks at. Great. I don't know about that, but... Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I'm just curious. You know, it's something that I have the bandwidth to do because of my role, and then I kind of disseminate stuff out to everyone. So the more that I can help them understand what's going on, I'm a resource to a lot of people. Yeah. That's awesome. In my organization. All right. Well, thank you for your time. We'll let you know if we run across any. Yeah, please do. We'll let you know if we run across any. That would be worth your time. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, anywhere in the, you know, eastern corridor down to D.C. and Baltimore. Sure. Is in my wheelhouse. The train goes. So, yeah. Well, and hopefully next time Jake and I are out there, we'd love to meet with you. We can get Mark out, too. Yeah. Yeah. He's such a good guy. Yeah. Is he still really calm? So calm. Oh, jeez. You guys. We used to always laugh. Like, if Mark was... Jake was a good buddy of mine, and we met working at Sam's Club together when we were in high school. But if Mark ever got mad, he'd be like... I am so mad right now. That's how mad... Yeah. He'd be like, that's not mad, Mark. That's good. That's like calm. He keeps things on even keel here at our place, because I tend to get pretty worked up, especially at work. By the end of the day, I'm like, really, guys? So, yeah. You're like, Mark had some wine or something. Yeah. Or something. Right. Exactly. Exactly. So, he's a good one, too. To, you know... To vocalize my frustrations, too, rather than vocalizing to my team. So... Yeah. We all need somebody like that. Yeah, we do. Jake and I both have the same thing at home. Yeah. Yep. It's good. But, yeah. And it was so great... Great to meet you. Thank you for your time. Yeah. And thanks to Mark for setting this up. Yeah. That's great. And for the introduction. And like we mentioned, we'll get that video off to you sometime early next week. Perfect. Sounds good. Enjoy. Nice to meet you. Have a good weekend. Have a good Halloween. Yeah. Take care. Bye-bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
