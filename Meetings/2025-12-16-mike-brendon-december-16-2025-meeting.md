## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This meeting centered on demonstrating and refining an AI-driven content generation and CRM engine developed by Code Name 37. The system automatically processes meeting transcripts, extracts entities, and builds dynamic GitHub Pages websites summarizing client interactions. The team showcased a live example built for Mosaic and discussed extending the approach to other clients such as Jana at Ipsos. The conversation also explored integration with bots, GitHub automation, and CRM workflows to streamline documentation and client engagement.

The discussion evolved into broader strategic and technical reflections on the company’s intelligence layer, graph and vector databases, and automation pipelines. Participants emphasized the potential to transform post-meeting documentation, proposal generation, and client communication through automated site creation. The tone was enthusiastic and exploratory, with recognition of the system’s potential as a differentiator. Later parts of the meeting shifted to internal planning for upcoming sessions with Stacy, addressing internal team performance, and preparing for AI Monitor project discussions. The overall direction was forward-looking, focused on operationalizing the new engine and aligning internal culture and technical capabilities.

## KEY DECISIONS
1. Proceed with using the automated engine to generate post-meeting websites summarizing client discussions. | Approved by: Mike and Jake | Rationale: Demonstrated success with Mosaic example.
2. Create a similar site for Jana (Ipsos) instead of a video. | Approved by: Mike and Jake | Rationale: Easier to share and embed video links.
3. Share the Mosaic site with Cody and BMC team. | Approved by: Mike | Rationale: Demonstrate system capability and maintain engagement.
4. Keep generated sites public but non-crawlable unless proprietary data is involved. | Approved by: Mike and Jake | Rationale: Balance accessibility with confidentiality.
5. Present the engine’s capabilities to Stacy and leadership as part of the intelligence engine demonstration. | Approved by: Mike and Jake | Rationale: Showcase value and integration potential.

## 📄 TRANSCRIPT

Wait a tick. Can you see my screen? Yes. Remember my idea? Remember the engine I told you about? Yeah, we were just talking about, yeah. I'm just building it all right now for Mosaic. Are you kidding me? No, check this out. Why is it going so fast? Taking our... Yeah, this is fucking awesome. So taking our... The meeting... Taking... Our meeting transcripts, plus the power of our bots. It went and grabbed everything. It went and grabbed everything about Cody. This is all from... This is all from the bot system. It went and grabbed everything about Cody, his entire background, everything he's got on LinkedIn, everything about him. It also went and grabbed everything about Mosaic, everything about him, including all the latest news, all their latest initiatives, everything. It pulled everything about them. And then, of course, there's our profile, right? So what it's doing, it's consolidating the two, taking the main themes from our conversation, which were... Which... Where is it? Why is this not opening? Oh, here we go. Ah, here we go. Oh, yeah. All the stuff he talked about right there. It grabs all the themes we talked about. ISO 42001, model transparency, it basically taken all those things and basically now it's going to... It's going to... It's going to... It's going to... It's going to... It's taking them all and forming the website as we speak. That's unbelievable. Governance first, AI enablement. We don't just deploy AI. We architect intelligent ecosystem. It's grabbing our language. This is so awesome. So the idea is moving forward in the future. So we don't miss anything anymore. Is we finish a meeting, those transcripts immediately get processed. They immediately go in the system and... See, that's what I've been waiting for, right? That CRM. I need that CRM tool. Even filling out those things yesterday on the conversations we had. I couldn't remember all of our conversations. I'm like, I had to go back. I'm trying to find... I would love to have access to all this stuff. But it's... The engine... The backend engines continuing to grow in intelligence. Like we were talking about, the more we feed it, the smarter it becomes. So between all these other things, like I said, it is just using... We only use LLMs for very specific things. These are perfect. Go find me with... Along with the bots. Go find me everything about Cody. What has he published? What has he done? Go find me everything about Mosaic. Pull it in here, right? Then bam. Now here's the point. Now we can build... So we have... Eight solution pages. Eight solution pages. Wow. And this is all in GitHub? And how do we pay for GitHub? How does that... How do we pay for that? Those are my private subscriptions right now. It's like... The GitHub pieces where I store my repos, it's 48 bucks a year. What? It's nothing. Microsoft almost... It gives GitHub away for nothing. Then you can enhance the capability if you want it, but then our needs are so basic. You know what I mean? In terms of what we're doing with repos. GitHub pages was... I don't know how many years old it is now. It's not bad and stuff like that, but it's grown really powerful in 2025. And the point is I was looking at it because when I was thinking about the idea of how the CRM would work and how we could publish content is... Now I'm thinking because basically with GitHub... I mean, no backends, no frontends, nothing. We just use GitHub as the... as a database and it's just... Well, you saw the example of it. It's just... GitHub becomes essentially the database because we don't need it for bigger things and we don't need to overcomplicate it, but there's really nothing to it. It's really just static pages, but then combined with our system, because it's a GitHub repo, we can just send commits to it and always update it. You know what I mean? The bots are like, we learned something new. Bam. And it'll send... If you're familiar with the software development process, we can do what's called a Git push, which is how we... When we're developing software, it pushes the latest updates from your development environment to GitHub and that's where everything is stored. Okay? Well, now from that, you can be like, oh, and by the way, build websites off of it. People just use it mainly as a code repository. Between our CRM and this, it's like actually we could kind of do a dual thing like this where it's like our CRM sends commands to it. You know what I mean? Mike Brandon wants... Mike Brandon's like, hey, I need a GitHub pages site based on the meeting we just had. The system knows it's got access to all of our repositories for like BMC Mosaic. And all of a sudden it's be like, yep, we know exactly what you want, Mike. Thank you. We have the content. Yeah. So that's... That's unbelievable. Instead of sending Word documents or PDFs, we can create these quick little websites, web pages. I'm already preparing for spatial computing, man. I'm not even like... You know what I mean? It's unbelievable. Just putting it in that form because then we can transition it all. If it's all in Word and shit, I won't be able to transition it. But starting with this, I can. Because then it's going to be like... Go ahead. So can you do me a favor? Can we do one for Yana? You know, we were going to do a video for Yana. Should we do a page for her instead? Do you think she would think that's cooler? Can we do a page and can we embed a video in that page? I haven't done it yet. But yeah, it shouldn't be too hard. The question is, is where... There's spatial limitations on... The videos have to be streamed from somewhere. That's the problem. GitHub is not a streaming service. You know what I mean? But if there's a link to Loom, would she be able to click on it in GitHub and get access? Yes. That we could do. So we could say, here's a short video depicting what we're doing here on this site, blah, blah, blah, right? Or here's our video based on our last conversation. The content's also in this site. I'm just looking at what it's building out here because I did the... Because I'd love to get back to Jana too. And I'm like, she's a UI person, right? UI, UX. She might think this is pretty cool. But I don't know if the video is just easier to describe things. It's so crazy that you can program, site addresses 17 key themes identified from discovery meetings. So what do you have? So you have... You're looking at the dialogue that we had with them. And then you have it also looking at who they are, their goals, initiatives, who he is, his background, his knowledge, who we are. And then do you have BMC mixed in here too? Yep. So did you tell it, take this information from our conversations and do these things? Is this what you said? Yep, I'll show you here in a second. Okay. All local repo changes to Git and push all local repo changes to GitHub. So here's the empty... Can you see my screen? Yes. Here's the empty repo on GitHub right now. It's empty. What this is doing, it's taking everything that we've done here and it's about to shove it to it. It's going to take everything from my local development environment and it's going to take... Yep, I'm going to ask you a question. Yep. It's going to... Yep. And it's going to push it all to the GitHub, sorry, the GitHub repo where immediately GitHub pages will publish it. So I'll show you, I'll show you... That's so cool. I'll show you to here in real time. I mean, it's sad that we, that I own a company where I'm still amazed that we can do this kind of stuff. You know? It's just amazing to me. What flashes before my eyes is all the opportunities we've missed because we couldn't do this kind of stuff, right? If they wanted documentation at OST, I just said, that's not going to happen. So my GitHub repos are all secured with what's called SSH keys? Sure. You know what I mean? We're done with that yesterday. They're all private. So bam. All right. There's everything now in the repo. Wow. So how do you take this and form the website? One second here real quick. Let me... To lightly mess it up to John. You get the push dump to If I diss喝 with you for just aال fucking minute... live stream, my H miracle system. So I can prick it in whoa, and see, let's finish we're still compacting and publishing sucks you're still sick dude when you get sick you really get sick remember last time with your you had that fever for a week that was COVID man ugh Austin wanted our addresses so he sent us something by the way Austin hey partner oh that Austin Austin from CloudMera hey partner can I get you and Jake's email or home addresses I want to send you a little something like you don't need to send us anything get up and then what do you mean it was already in there commit push amazing you stopped sharing huh hold on hold please um um. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Uh, what's going on here? Oh, that's what that is. Copy. So what I'm dealing with right now is I did, um, the other one under my personal account and I changed that up and I set up a new, basically a new folder with new permissions to, to do more of this stuff as we wrap at rapidly built it out this morning and I'm getting permissions error. So I'm just going through all that right now. Okay. It'll just be a. A minute here. Pretty cool stuff though. What do you mean it's not enabled? Okay. You don't start your deeper stuff and in your bottom part of the Google handlebar. We have one think right now that it's움. It's room 변. do . Oh, so we're just going to have an airport needs. Ah, how do we get on? Oh. Uh, uh. I just there are some times I even amaze how much of an idiot I am an idiot one of the smartest guys I know oh shit yeah there we go yeah docs folder it's in docs right yeah is it in the docs folder maybe maybe maybe not is it I don't know it might be I don't know one second Dan that guy is so funny why what's going on with Dan Dan from the bank because I was just talking to him and Eric but he's just been talking to me and I was like hey man the date couldn't be better this guy would smoke a lot of weed or something he's just so chipper and I don't think the day could be going any better yesterday you know I saw him late in the day yesterday and he's like in the afternoon and he's like oh you know I just had all this stuff and just been real busy and he goes but I'm not complaining it's going to be busy he caught himself going down the road to work with me right now of you know different ways I mean man covering my positivity back I like it I love the positivity does your hands get super dry in the winter they do I never had a problem until like last year I don't know if it's like an old age thing but now that if I don't take care of them they're bleeding oh you know they just break open I'm like this sucks this is an old age thing this is why old people move to Florida it's exactly why old people move to Florida like I just I put Vaseline on my hands last night and socks my boys like what are you doing I'm like I don't know I gotta try get rid of this somehow this is nuts I Vaseline in the socks sounds different okay I see what it did I was deploying it from a branch interesting what's a branch like a all right I'm such a fucking idiot but just go with it all right it's a lot of coating all right oh my yeah is this this site already yeah this makes me smile I love it can we just use this as a web page going forward you yeah it's even pulling out quotes I love it I'm still using our decision mash infusion grid I love it so far I mean this is better than a weapon oh this is really good Wow you you you I believe you need to go back and look at it again because you accepted doesn't mean your organization is ready is there a way to change the font on here so it's a little bigger or is a bigger on your end it's bigger on my end okay good no I mean I can read it just fine I want to make sure he can so if it's bigger on your end you're going to I'll send you the link to this and tell me what it looks like on your machine this is on a Linux box I love what it says at the top our approach I love it I'll grab my diagrams I love it this actually worked for the first run it actually worked out pretty well there's a few it looks really good honestly looks better than our web page there's a few things I would want to change but this is actually pretty good so I'm gonna send you how do we take this and formulate our web page with it how do we take this and formulate our web page with it how do we take this and something like this not the same one yep hold on let me put this in chat so where's the next did you see suggested use cases what's that is there a suggested use cases in here we never discussed it with them it was man can it go ahead can it grab some like based on our conversation can it go out and say hey hey these are some of the things we suggest yeah I'm in I'm in I'm in it right now this looks really really good and Jake does it she's it's unbelievable did it get that right oh look at that takes us right to our LinkedIn pages that's pretty impressed it actually worked out pretty well I'm gonna go ahead my LinkedIn pages i'm gonna start my LinkedIn pages now since I got so excited to do this oh we're gonna do this this is gonna be friends no good we looked and out cut we are trained to scan the restaurants but we have to be focused on where supermarkets are doing what all the state-wide lives are doing and from here we're gonna say tasted okay you have these folks right here in the directly on the text it has done it all and she's also giving me like kind of a look under his belt he always says we're gonna take care of like a terry Miller drink out or do some of your customer service we're gonna say from here when we get your drugs for an example guys dad다�ья br��y arrivDia w trusting how is that AI governance model transfer I mean these are all the topics it grabbed every single topic we discussed with him that makes sense yeah so click on data foundation down there you yeah that's pretty cool are we covered a lot of topics in a short period of time I mean we touched on a lot so so if you said if you were to send this to Cody what would you say hey Cody and feel free to send it I love for him to see this come from you since you built it unless you want me to send it which I'm happy to go ahead send it to you but hey Cody go ahead yeah hey Cody so what we did is we took our conversation that we had and we put all that documentation into a site for you right and github don't even have to tell him it's github he probably doesn't care he'll see it he'll see it up there we put it all into a site for you that contains all the information that we talked about and answers to a lot of those a lot of those topics but then during all that beauty that we just talked about and then the final but still important part is looking at your analytics right I think it's pretty cool stuff Jake it's just crazy to me that you just did this it is all that's the found the foundation for which is absolutely why we always and I mean always here let me show you can you still see my screen yeah yep I'm looking at it so this is the bot breakdown of our entire meeting the for the one we had with Cody right and it's analyzing everything right there's grace there's Cody it got his name wrong but anyway it still gets my name wrong and I wrote the fucking thing go figure I know this is a hallucination I don't know who the hell I went anyway but it summarizes it so basically this is the entire transcript this is every word that we said but on top of all this it analyzes everything right it's a introductory meeting code name present code name 37 presented its background blah blah blah blah blah next steps Cody connect with Michael and Jake on LinkedIn for continued engagement topics discussed technical so it goes through the transcript and it goes through the transcript and it goes through the graphs everything absolutely everything then top technical discussions on all the the main themes that we touched on business updates people updates insights and takeaways risk as concerns blah blah blah blah blah then Cody's gonna further explore it this is just everything gets taken everything we've discussed and goes into our graph data database this is the whole foundation of the CRM all the relationships now you've got the entities that were grabbed here this is how it all works in the back end mosaic and Coney in 37 the date we discussed with them this is all the entities that make our system smart all these things are now connected with each other so when you say by the way who's Cody McGaughy or McKay or how reality says it again I do here for now it's gonna be like yeah dude you guys talked to him a year ago and you talked to him about all the things that you've come across this is the cal welton then should be we've got the things that we've done and then we've got the metadata the viewpoints we'll have that link and it was just a very very very quickly outdated in that it would be to send something down here it would use the whole nota hit the URL that장 these are some of our documents this is the code we left on our ramp's you me hat us sleep so well again is that hand-picked I get a like if you are just like so if you areило sävenge num beckel president the submit that and we give up residencephants magazine 몇 hundred and a half up to 20 or one Favorites content fort enroll yourself then it just does sale out there and it helps me see good for your saw your payoff service that said that's a pretty good list I don't have too many that we used for the university. I just refactored it quickly and be like, you know what? We're gonna now do this with it and kablam, now we can do that. That's just, it's amazing, Jake, nicely done. This is unreal. I mean, look at it, it looks like a real webpage. It did a really good job with our branding. It's not too bad. The code name with the orange 37 is actually kinda cool. The orange, the white, the black. Yeah, I mean, it matched all the colors we use. I told it to, it's designed to, you know what I mean? Really, really cool. So anyway, no, send away, but this is like moving forward. We do this after every single one. Should we do this for Yana, do you think? Or do you think it's too much? We can, we can go grab her conversations right now and spin up the site. She, cause we had the conversations and then we also had the email she sent us about Google and their new release, remember? I wonder if we could tie it all in. sollten wir ein little weiter. What's their company again, remind me. Yana's at a, fuck, what's the name of the company? I'll find it. Its been like this for the last two weeks. It's... Just mind burping. It's Ibona, no, what is it? Ah fuck, I gotta look it up. Ipsos, I-P-S-O-S. so I got this is so this is so cool gosh what I haven't it wouldn't be a big deal so we'll do that one real quick and then we'll do like the um we'll embed the video but let me just grab here real quick we should actually show this to Stacy this would be money for them why the intelligence engine oh I think we I think we should totally show runner Cole coming up we're just saying on hey for our intelligence engine this is what we get out of it this is why we use graphs and pieces for sales and everything else like that but like for example you know here's what spit out it's just the information that we have from the data that we're getting and so we can actually And don't get me wrong, it took me a little bit to refactor. I know we talked about it, but I just went ahead and did it this morning. So essentially it's set to go. I just want to make a few changes to it, but it's ready to go. We can do this after every meeting. We just need the transcript. That's the key. I mean, this is going to be so fun to say. You know, I'm typing the email to Cody right now. Apologies for not getting this info to you sooner. Here's the website we created that captured our conversation. And write this out. Make sure the link works. Actually, when you get a chance, try this in mobile too. I'm betting, yeah, it's mobile responsive, it looks like. Which is actually pretty cool. Appreciate it. I'm still looking at. I'm still looking at what we saw of the solutions. Let me see. I'm still looking at the. I love. I love. I want them to know that this is the, you know, this is what we, this site is what we built that captures our conversation. And the documentation is discussed like this was built for you. This is mosaic only. Should these sites be public or private? I would think private, don't you? Because what if they give us proprietary information? This is all public information. I mean, this conversation was all public information. You know what I mean? It's essentially marketing data. I think if we have ones that we build where it's specific, we have NDAs in place, and we're doing a full architecture. Oh, yeah, we can put them behind a wall. That's not the issue. It's just a matter of, you know, this one. I mean, this is public. No, don't get me wrong, these things are not crawlable, either. The engines aren't going to find them. You know what I mean? But they're public. You have to have the link to get to it. Yeah. So I mean, unless somebody hacked the email, right, then we should be okay. What do you mean, hacked the email? Sorry. Well, you said that you have to do a link, but if somebody got the email message I sent out with the link in it. Yeah, if you got the link, you can get to it. But it's not crawlable. It's not searchable. You know what I mean? Don't, don't get me wrong, if somebody really wanted to, I mean, I guess, I mean, rock your socks out, you could guess our naming convention based on things, I guess. You know what I mean? But you just can't search for it. So, but I mean, no, if it's proprietary, I agree. I think we put it behind a wall and say, I'm like, okay, here's, you know what I mean? Yes. Here's a general jest. You know what I mean? Yep. So, if we were to do our proposals this way, which would not be a leap, because again, this isn't me building up the content, the engine builds out the content. We could actually do our proposals this way. And then at the end, it's like now download your proposal. You know what I mean? Here's your downloaded version of it. You know what I mean? Yeah. Another way of spying. Here's what we're doing. Here's the idea. Here's the piece. Create the, you know, rapidly, you know, blow this up. And by the way, here, click here to download it. I mean, I'm just, uh, actually we could build jazz. We could actually build the automation in terms of approve it. You want it or sign your, uh, that's a later thing. We could even build in a doc. You sign integration in there. You're like click, you know, sign here. This is, I feel like this is a game changer, Jake. I mean, it's so, it's so unique. Like, do you think many people are doing this for their customers and prospects? I don't know how to do the automation of this. Like I said, I learned how to do it, when I learned how to build out master and doctoral level courses and an hour. You know what I mean? So I've made every mistake learning how to do all this stuff. But I mean, that's the whole point is like, how do you rapidly, and through automation rapidly build out these experiences in this content? Like I said, you just saw this one. I just had a reconfigure some things this morning, but outside of that, after we have the transcripts after they're processed this whole thing is 20 minutes maybe 20 maybe 30 unbelievable that that after 30 minutes it could be like here's everything we've discussed are you good if i send this yeah fire away let's see what he says it's so cool did you copy bmc on it yeah i copied grayson awesome and yourself yeah it's a different i just think we man we always look for you know what are those ways of like we can continually create those experiences and then like you know for example um can you still see my screen i was i'm digging on your page i'm back your screen is not sharing i was just looking through the solutions that you uh that are recommended or that i pulled based on the conversation for example actually we would do how do we want to do this yeah we could literally do this um it'd be a cool way to tie it with the bot system and you know what i mean this becomes uh we just do what's called the github action and say basically talk to the bot system and you know what i mean or the bot system pushes commands to this to build something like that you know what i mean for i'm not following for for what piece jake i'm thinking of like i'm thinking of you working in the crm system hey i'm working on this hey i'm working on um um uh i'm working on um or i'm working on um I want to do a, I'm following up again with, you know, a prospect or something along those lines. Following up with John at Johnson Brothers regarding or need info, right? Based on our last conversation. Is that where you're going? Kind of, but like, let's say like, hold on one second. Um, think of it like you're following up with Johnson Brothers, but you're also like, what's the latest and greatest news and intelligence and stuff like that? Our bots already know that. So you're saying, hey, bots, dumbasses, wake the fuck up back there. You're saying, go get me the latest and greatest intelligence while it already has. So it's pulled it, right? So you're saying now go ahead and update the GitHub pages site. And I'm going to, and you send off a new link to John. If John kept the link, um, or we would keep the same link. It would just be active. You know what I mean? But I mean, it'd be basically, then all of a sudden the bots would send a command to GitHub to this here. That's kind of what you're seeing here. It's going to force an update. That's going to do a build, which is what this thing is. And it's going to, I don't see her. I'm not seeing your screen. Really? I see you. And your flashy lights on your computer. There you go. Now do you see me? Yeah. The screen. Yep. Yeah. So it's going to send a command, which is called like a GitHub action. And it's going to go through this whole process. This is all the automation, set up a job. Mike's got changes, check out, whatever, set up the technologies that we're going to use for the build, right? That's all automated, set up the pages, push the updates to the site. Bam, bam, bam, complete the job post done. Wow. So all the automations, like I said, I've already, they're all built. I've already built them all. So that's the, hopefully you're seeing a little bit as I wrap up the front end here. But like the back end works. Awesome. That was the key. Having all these things work together to be able to take data and just be like here. You know what I mean? Analyze. Yeah. Any type of data. And that's where, when we talk about the intelligence layer, that's been part of like my 2025 was learning how to do all that and do it really well, where literally I can take a transcript and our system is so good at extracting the entities from everything. It's like, oh yeah. But what can we do? We can analyze, we can sell, we can build sites from it. We can do anything from it. That's our point to Stacy, which is let us show you what we do. You know what I mean? Let us show you how advanced our systems are that we can take from anything because of the intelligence layer between graphing of relationships. We haven't even gotten into, oh, by the way, who's everybody Cody McGill is connected to that I know. You know what I mean? Yeah. Show me that. Show me. Show me. I mean, it's the whole point. The point is the system's designed to see connections that we can't see without a lot of homework. That's the point. Yeah. It's all about the connections in the data set and us seeing insights that others don't. And our latest innovation here, rapidly building any type of content from it. It's like that in 20 minutes. That's so cool. In 20 minutes. So same thing. I mean, it's just, it blows my mind. Same thing with what we did for BrandPoint. Here's the different, the general textieht aside, is there aren't an app in the form of, hey, we got when weiles outro which is that and uh then we've certainly shown in the last couple minutes that now there's going to be anything that's connected to a Snape Yes. That's like theкол- The muit- The more kunna- That's what I'm talking about. The Kimberly chez that data that our Osaka gets, you're ge monsieur comes into this stuff. Yeah. It's done. It only shows if you close 2017 guidelines, kids can play hell if you're in a realistically aggressive play boy, but everything in Tinder does glowing暴 somler on you if you're in the Internet in any season that year. you'll be able to build, analyze anything is the point, once you start capturing data this way, you know what I mean? Yeah, it's, man it's, there's endless ideas here we can easily meet with somebody and the site could be as simple as here's what we discussed or here's what we heard, right? And here's our recommendations or, yeah, it could be so simple it's just it's so cool, we don't have to send little emails around that are like five paragraphs long, we say here, it's all up here in the site, here's how we got it labeled the result is, it's so much richer so all that's in front of the client it's, you know it's desire it's the best But this is the... This is what we're trying to tell people. Is to analyze, create... How do you want to say it? Like when we talk about intelligent systems. Analyze, create, connect anything. You know what I mean? When we say we build intelligent systems. You know what I mean? Just you name it. I did talk to Shrey. He went to a startup in New York. He did not. He still wants to talk to us. He's, again, still interested. Still wants to proceed. Nothing. Nothing's changed. But no, he went to a... He's still... He's not moving. He's working out of here. You know what I mean? But he works for a startup in New York called Tools... Tools... Tools Cock. Tools Box. What the fuck is it called? But yeah, he went to a startup. Something tells me, though, that startup's working on the cutting frickin' edge. And he thought his skills were getting lax. I don't blame him. I wouldn't work for a big corporation. I wouldn't work for a big corporation right now. I'd fucking go stale. No way. Unless they gave me carte blanche to innovate. Forget it. You know what I mean? No way. So they must be a startup that got a bunch of funding to afford them. You know? I don't know. I would hope so. But... Did he move? Are they moving? No. Not that I know of. Not that I can tell. He's working from here. But I can... I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. But anyway, no. Well, now we can use his Cargill background. His background's unquestioned. His background blows mine away. His is unreal. Well, we couldn't use it before, but now we can. Hey, don't just talk to us. Talk to our co-founder of this particular area, right? Who not only knows this stuff, built this stuff for Cargill. And look at all these press releases they had on it. We could go after agriculture and everything now. He doesn't have a non-compete, does he? Well, I don't know. Didn't get... We just exchanged. We just went back and forth on LinkedIn a little bit. I just told him, hey, I was... Jake, this could open the door for us. Potentially. Ask him if he has a non-compete with Cargill, because we could go after all this egg stuff that's looking to do what he did. Yeah, Cargill. Do we build egg solutions? But we have to see what the IP around it is. But that's the whole kind of funny thing about this space. Did he... Anything he custom wrote, Cargill will own. Anything he used open source is free game, which that's probably the majority. Well, we have to rewrite it. Fine. He's got the expertise. Yeah, 100%. I have a feeling after we talk to him, man, I have a feeling it's going to be... He just got bored. It just got... He wanted... You know what I mean? He did the implant thing. He did the drone thing. And then it's kind of like... It's not... It's Cargill. It's not moving fast. And he's just like, you know, come on, let's go. Then they laid off a bunch of people. They laid off his boss. They laid... You know what I mean? It's just... It's bullshit. And it's just like... I think he... I would be willing to bet in terms of talking to him, either he thought he was growing stale or he thought he was going to get cut. Yeah, I bet you that's it. He was like, hey, I'm not having fun anymore. Well, if you're sitting at Cargill, and like I said, if you don't see the value of vision system, it's just like, dude, I can't help you. It's kind of like... Shrey and I joke sometimes about why in the world do we teach? Like, it's like banging your head against the fucking wall trying to change these 150-year-old institutions. It's like, why do we even do this? Why do you even bother talking about this shit? Because it's like, we're talking about cutting-edge stuff and all they want to talk about is the syllabus. Yeah. Hey, so your format of your syllabus is wrong. It's like, really? I'm bringing that up because actually I got that email the other day and I'm like, I said it the nicest way and the good Christian way. Fuck off. Like, get the fuck out of here. If you want to change the color, change the fucking color. Jesus. Do you honestly think the student gives a shit about the yellow banner versus the fucking blue? Fuck off. Oh, by the way, we made recommended changes two and a half years ago on this shit and you guys are still talking about it. So. Talk to me later. I'll see you after the new year. We want your program. We want the AI thing to be this, this. Yeah, good for you. It's like, I'll talk to you guys in the new year when I have time. Anyway. What do you think we're going to discuss with Stacy today at noon? I want to ask her. I'm sure she's got what she wants. I mean, you said we were just connecting, right? And it's just like, I do want to have that conversation where it's like, hey, Stace, I'm willing to play the game as long as you want me to. But if this is how we're going to spend our time, you know what I mean? Is this how you want us to spend our time? I mean, I'm literally, I mean, we'll, we'll play it by ear in the conversation, but I seriously, it's just a, I get he completely disagrees with everything we're doing. And I get, he doesn't want us here. Fair enough. Give me a roadblock. What do you want us to do? She might tell us, she might be telling us maybe, I'm sorry, Jay, could you give me one second? It's that time. You know me. Dancing over here. It's not cutting in, I can feel all this much loss right now, like how much of it isolation? I can't feel my body green. My stomach still feels like Ragdoll. Sorry about that. No worries. So you were saying you want to talk to her about, do we deal, how do we deal with Duder? Like your money? Hey, I, wow. Actually, let me show you this real quick too. So as our system, you see my screen? Big black screen. Yes. So as we, as we identify these themes in our meetings, right. In terms of predictability and things of that nature, our system also goes grabs the latest, greatest research on these topics. Meaning here's one like around, and we talked about predictability with brand point and went and pulled an article about, you know, the mathematical field, that creative, you know, blah, blah, blah. Basically it's all around predictability and basically it does a complete breakdown. It just, it does. I have my way of analysis, but then that's all automated. It goes and pulls all of it. It's like, why is this thing? Why is it relevant to decision implications? Blah, blah, blah. Risk assessment opportunities, timeline. What is the academic view of it? What is the business view of it? You know what I mean? All these other things, right. And so on. So anyway, it's kind of cool in terms of how it does it, but it's, um, yeah, that's really cool. I'm just reading each of these. Yep. And what it does is same thing that I mentioned before. All these things go in the graph, all of it. It goes in the graph and it goes in the vector. It takes all of these things. And so our system is filled with all these entities of data and they're connecting with one another. Meaning on the, on the chain, it's like brand point and predictability and intelligence systems. And this is another connection like this Pavel Merkosov, right? One of the authors of this article is now a connection on along that chain. You know what I mean? So, and here's like the mathematics view of it. And then it also breaks down the article this way. Cause this is all what's analyzed analyzed in terms of, you know, the data, but same idea, same thing. But that's when we're talking to them about ingesting this data and putting it in this format. Adam just can't see it cause he's never done it. And like I said, I don't fault him for it. I'm not judging him on it. It's just, it's that he's never done it. It's a, it's a ton to learn, but it's a, when you start to analyze data this way, you can do all the things that you're seeing. We can now be the beginnings of what we're doing. Bam. Here's a website. Bam. Here's a, you know, instant analysis, bam, here's this, it changes your operations as a whole of everything that you can do. You know what I mean? Just from that one foundation, it's just, if you can start, if you do that to all of your data, just about anything is, I mean, sure. Anything is possible. That makes sense. I can make perfect sense. I can tie, I can tie bots to the system. I can tie web pages to the system. I can tie mobile applications to the system. I can tie, you know what I mean? Once I have that foundation, Oh, you know what I mean? Oh, wait, now anything is possible. That's kind of the, maybe we start off the meeting that way of saying, Hey, just, we just want to show you, we want to show you a little bit of what we do. You know, we're not gonna show you everything, but it's like, here's just an example of how our intelligent system works and what we can, what we're able to do sales wise, marketing wise, research wise, instant. Um, analysis for our media. I mean everything. I think that's, I think that's perfect. You can show the one you just did right. And say, Hey, here's a conversation we had with another company. Um, the outcome of this meeting was they wanted more documentation to take the leadership for the plans for next year. And you know, our here's what our engine did for us. Yep. And again, that's just even a draft. You can change it and change it if you want, right. Push it in a different direction if you want it, but honestly, not much out of change. And it's really, I mean, that's the growing sophistication and complexity of how machine learning looks at the patterns in the data set, how deep learning is making connections in the data set based all built on systems that are designed to do that. And so it, well, it's like, well, how did it know, how does it know that? How does it know so much about us? And it's like, well, you know what I mean? It's got all that information and it's a, it's cool. And that's, we're just scratching the surface on the cool side of it. It's a cool kind of experiences and things that we'll do anyway with that. So no, I'm thank you for pushing me on that today. And I'm sorry I dropped the whole piece, but hopefully that's, no, I didn't want to buy. I didn't know it was this easy for you because you haven't built it off. I thought you had more, a lot of work to do to, it's not, I mean, it's not, you know, I was looking at under solutions, what am I on there? Operational technology and human safety. So you even have a little, even pulled out a little blurb saying human being safety is top priority for me, Cody McGaughy or whatever. And you can put his little, his little statement in there. I want to make sure that's accurate. Did I say that? Or did he say that? I think he might've said that human being safety is a top priority for me. He was talking through what matters most. So I'm going to guess that came from him. So imagine, so there are machine learning models built in our system, deep learning. We haven't accessed this data yet, but every time we, this is the ethics side of it. We'll note, we'll be able to identify him because we have him on video. You know what I mean? We have his identity. We have his LinkedIn page. We have, we'll know his voice, which is kind of freaky in that way. But I mean, you know what I mean? We'll know it's him. We could actually be able to take a recording and submit, I mean, in time we'll be able to take a recording, put it in our system and it's going to say, Oh, I know that's Cody. You know what I mean? The likelihood it's an 86.2% chance that that is Cody based on his mannerisms, based on, you know what it's actually kind of free, but it's the same. That's the ecosystem. That's the stuff that we're grabbing. Now we're not, we're not grabbing it for that purpose, but we have it. You know what I mean? Does that make sense? Yeah. Yeah. It makes perfect sense. But the, where people are going to get this wrong is the architecture of this is to make all of this. What you've seen, I've like, we started down this path and kind of, kind of done it, but then we just got, I got hooked on this intelligence layer because it's everything. It's everything. If I can, any, anything, audio video to, I don't give a flying fiddle, fuck what it is about going and getting it. I mean, but it brings it's brought into the system and it's immediately processed, analyzed, and then it's now in a usable form for how to, how do you want to access it? Do you want to build content from it? Like a get up page, a site? Do you want to help a sales guy? Do you want, do you want, do you want, do you want, you know what I mean? But that's, it's complicated and you can't, um, how the databases are configured is complicated. How the bots and agents work with it is complicated. You know what I mean? But this is as close as we're going to get. This is as close. We're not a gen tech yet, but it'd be fun to be first. Cause that, how do you, these are all the conditions, for a genetic systems. Go ahead. How do you show, goes back to that. I talked to you about a few days ago. How do you show the intelligence layer in like a picture from our perspective and what we're doing? So think of the things you just said, you got like videos and pictures and data. You got the customers siloed stack, right? Um, envision like a picture that tells a story of what we do. Uh, uh, with the intelligent layer, right? That's what I'd love to get to. I love to be able to show a picture. You got the intelligence layer, right? And you got all this stuff that's feeding in and up and like to be able to tell that story in a simplistic way. So people like, oh, see what they're doing. Like if I was a CTO of a massive enterprise, there would be nothing in that enterprise that I would not vector and graph. Nothing. I would emails everything. There would be, you know what I mean? But think of like, think of the infrastructure that would take to do that. It's probably not even possible. Well, let's say you're a legal company, right? And you're like, oh shit. Did anybody, did anybody send an email related on this topic? If it's all vector to grab, you can pull up every email like that. That was, that had any description of that in there. And be like, okay, yeah, we did send three emails that violated this blah, blah, blah. But you can pull it up like that. The challenge is, is like, how much do you hold in memory for it to be instant? That's the challenge. How much do you hold in memory? How much do you, that it has to search for? Don't get me wrong. You could easily say, Hey, this is like, this is from, you know, six months ago. So we're going to access basically long-term mentally. And essentially it's going to the vector database and being like, so where is that? It, but it might take, might take 35 seconds. You know what I mean? If you can even just type it in and let it run, if you gotta go to archive storage or not, it shouldn't, you know, but it takes a little extra time. Yeah. Not a big deal. A smart system deploys a new bot of saying, no, I know what you're asking. This is going to be a bigger task. I'm going to deploy a sub agent right now. That's going to go handle this while you and I are still talking. Yeah. What else do you need while we're doing this? It's not going to be like sit and wait, sit and wait. It's like no bottom line. So this is going to go when that sub agent is complete. And then all of a sudden you see a little visualization over here and you see what that sub agent is doing. Then you're like, and how else can I help you in the meantime, while we go retrieve that long-term information in the archives, if you will, you know what I mean? Just shit like that. It's just, it's like, that's the kind of like, as we talk about, cause what's really, what's really important is, you know, what does this front user, what is this of all this stuff? What does this front end user interface look like more and more? I'm leaning towards that. It's a, it's a main agent that dispatches sub agents. No sub agents show you what you want to see based on what you, you know what you want, but they function in parallel. You know what I mean? Think of it like a concierge at a hotel. Hi, can you help me? Yeah, no problem. Or I forgot my toothbrush. A man. Imagine right there digitally, a little sub agent goes and gets you your fricking toothbrush. Imagine, you know what I mean? Hey, while, Hey, while they're doing that, let's do good recommendations for dinner tonight. And all of a sudden the sub agent comes out and be like, yep, I'll, I'll help that with over here while the concierge is like, and anything else? Cause I can juggle 15 balls at once, buddy. What do you got? What do you want from me? You know what I mean? That's my, the concierge doing this. That's the idea. Pretty much. That's the idea I have in my head of like this, um, ubiquitous main agent that's surrounded by that dispatches these sub agents, whatever the person wants, whatever the rep wants. Oh, you want research on this duder? We're going to go dispatch five duders, pulling that up for you right now, by the way, here it is. You know what I mean? Here's this, here's this, you know what I mean? All that kind of stuff. Um, then when spatial computing comes now, imagine that you'll be able to see that like live, like we're talking to iron man kind of shit. Yeah. You know what I mean? That kind of stuff. Um, all the stuff we've been seeing on CSI forever is going to come to real life. You know, they're pulling up things on glass and moving shit around and it's like, yeah, you wish that was real. So one of the other things I'm working on for the school and it's not done yet. Um, we can also now inject imagery is working really well. Video is not working yet, but it's almost there. These are, these are, this is a, so I lead a project that students are working on. I'm just like the, you know what I mean? They report in with me kind of stuff, but I put them down this direction, which is figure this out. I figured out how to build courses in record time. You guys figure out how to do imagery and video based on the con. So think of like, based on this meeting we just had, imagine the AI creating a video, that also tells that story. That would be amazing. Yeah. I'm, I'm almost there. It's not ready yet, but it's almost there. Then we'll do the same thing. We'll pull that engine over and we'll just use it. It's almost. And then can we have it use like our voices as it builds the story? So it sounds like it's us talking. Not yet. You can do things like that. There's lots of engines out there, but you gotta, you gotta train it like a docker in time. So like, I'm thinking of like all of our loom videos. It'll know like my voice. You do a loom bit videos. It'll know your voice, but yeah, we got to train it on what your voice is. That's how these guys who are fucking with politicians, they take, they're all public and they're in the media all the time. So they take all these snippets and they train the model on Biden's voice. You know what I mean? That's how it's done. They're just training a, a machine learning model that learns his voice. Every word catalogs, every word he says, even the slurs. Sorry. I don't mean to describe America in one word. I would describe America in one word. My favorite one was he was at an airfield somewhere. And the whole thing, he's not a senior, spitting his<|en|> betraying fibula. Heczne Peter,Ps Palmukes, This is the first one I've done in my life. And I love the whole like way of him saying that in America, like I could have been gonna have leaving my last why don't you. Like I know that's amazing. He's just another, this isn't just a joke. I mean, I mean I said that before when I was doing my last, last gala that my dad had held. first, like that's elder abuse nobody should be able to be I mean I know Trump sold to but there should be a cutoff but that I love the investigation that's going on there because it's like and what fucking decisions did you assholes cuz that's a call to coup what decisions did you assholes this auto pen bullshit what decision is you fucking hung power hungry assholes do you want to mean anyway it's just about this shit that they have proved with that auto pen especially the last like two months yeah I'm fucking believable what dumbass didn't think about that two years ago and say hey we should slowly start doing these things with the auto pen not do them all at one time at the end of the term yeah all you know that shit's gonna get overturned it's all gonna get overturned I mean the picture of Biden in the White House right now is the auto pen picture of the auto pen and Biden's outside of like getting Stacy's feedback everything got posted to the SharePoint so I zipped everything up thank you everything's in there it's in their SharePoint updated the Asana page yeah what is um what what's the point of the meeting what's our goal tomorrow so we we booted the meeting from today to be joined with tomorrow what's the goal in tomorrow's meeting is it a definite plan for AI monitor and how to move that forward and then start documenting the steps we need to get done for the engine or what what are your thoughts there go through um I'll be done with going through all the sequel data to that today I'm sorry on that one so between Amy target yeah we've been seeing social media is getting big and it'soug mastering channel at six the number three post made up around nine classes total episodes presto what is happening and they're back in forever fucking data. And here's what we see. We already gave you what we see on AI Monitor just from that quick data set. Now we've looked at everything and we'd be like, here's the opportunities we believe that you have based on your current data set. In terms of other insights, other capabilities, what this starts to look like in a vector, in a graph, what this starts looking like using a graph and a vector, building out the intelligence layer, if you will. And again, here's how all these things are going to make AI Monitor smarter, if you will. Because like I said yesterday, I hear what he's saying, but he's not collecting the right data or they don't have the right data to do that level of analysis, which is just funny. Why can't we do that? I don't have that in the data set. It's like you showed. It's like, where in this data set do you see your client's goals? How am I supposed to know that? How am I supposed to know that? You know what I mean? That's not what you provided me. So it's kind of just funny. He's like, he's trying to irk. But at the same time, it's like, dude, where in this data set do you see this shit? Right? You want to put a layer on top of that? It's like, he doesn't even put the things together that he's trying to string together. To try to hurt me or hurt us or whatever. But anyway, that's Stacy's call. Like I said, I'll play the game and it's fine. And tomorrow it's like, what do you want tomorrow to be? I'm presenting opportunities. You can disagree with them all day long. These are the things I'm recommending and why. Again, come up with a better idea. You know what I mean? Go ahead. Yeah, I'm thinking through this because based on what Stacy said yesterday, which she'll probably bring up today, we got to set up the culture. We got to set up the culture. Here's what we've done. Here's what we've looked at. And after looking at your data, these are the things that we're going to discuss today and with our recommendations, right? It's like, we got to talk like they're, they don't know anything about what we're talking about. I think is where Stacy wants us to go. Because I think it's over their head, everything you're talking about. You're not doing anything wrong. They're just not. But we got to think of them as a bunch of Lisa's, right? Ouch. I don't, I think we do like Brendan gets some of it, but he only knows the tools that he knows. You know what I mean? Yeah. And he hasn't had a very strong leader in the data realm. Right. And programming realm. And I think, I think Brendan and especially Adam have been. Just milking this company for you. Well, I wouldn't say Brendan. I think Adam's been milking this company for years. Do the minimal. I mean, how does the guy stay busy eight hours a day? Minimum. Oh, I. Doing that job. I can tell you right now, building fricking VPNs makes it look busy. Oh yeah. Spent three hours doing VPN. I mean, you literally spent. Yeah. 72 hours getting me. We signed the deal on Monday. We kicked off on, no, we signed the deal on a Friday. We kicked off on a what? Monday, Tuesday. It took you till Friday to get me access. Don't get me wrong. They moved quickly, but think about that. It took you till you're a 40 person company. It took your systems are so complex. It took you till Friday. I can easily see how it keeps. Yeah. Myself busy. Mike. It took you till Friday to get me access to everything because of your security system for a 40 person company. Well, we want you to access all of our stuff. It's like, dude, I'm not saying expose your database to the world. That's not what I'm saying. I'm saying, by the way, there's native AWS tools and utilities that are just fine. I get that they're not up to your standard that you feel you need to do 17 more layers on top of that. But I'm sorry for a 40 person company. Sorry. Why? Why do you think Lisa? Why do you think Stacy keeps doing all this research and sending us stuff on like stacker and other things? It's competing tools. She's just doing it. She's seeing what else is in the market. Which is. Good. But I think I thought we had a pretty good idea of where we want to go and how we want to help. And does it bother you at all that she does that? Or do you like it? There's no Mike. There's no keeping up with this space. AI monitor. And this is what they have to understand. Whatever we launch with is going to change within two months. Oh, I'm sure. Guys, it's just it's a AI monitor needs to be continually updated. Continually. You know, optimize needs to be continually updated. There's going to be it is going to be an ongoing effort to maintain the ecosystem and to innovate on the ecosystem. So that fact that she's doing that. The challenge for her is going to be I understand how she functions and operates, but that's one of the challenges of working in paper. You know what I mean? How is she going to? Analyze and automate all this data? What I mean? She's going to go to all these places and print it out. Don't get me wrong. That's an option. But that's I'm arguing that's not fast enough. Don't get me wrong. Could we build? Actually, we could turn our bots loose on that, too, and just be like, you know what? Constantly pull the late, you know. All the time, because it's going to more shit's going to come out in this space. Because these guys are running scared in terms of relevancy. You know? I mean, quickly. So. They have to write survival for them. Yeah. Don't get me wrong. I saw an article that Databricks rose four billion. So there are 134 billion evaluation. That crazy. I can Databricks. Unbelievable. But they're having, I just saw another video with him. He's seeing the same thing we do in the enterprise. It's just, it's like. They're moving, but they're not moving. They don't know what to do. And it's just a they don't have the I think it's more the talent gap. They would love to move, but they it's really tough, you know, and that's where it because I appreciate your feedback. It's easy to sit and talk about this stuff when you live it. And it's like everyone should already know this, but they don't. You know what I mean? They're not. That's a great reminder as to not to talk over people's heads in that regard. It's just people aren't living. You know? eating and breathing this stuff every day. I can sit here all day long and say, how can you not? But they're not. Well, think these are traditional IT people, a lot of people we deal with, right? Or people in the business that know nothing about a lot of this stuff. And it's moving so quickly and they read the, they'll read the headlines and what they see out there. And that's why you get people like that Charlie at Johnson Brothers saying, oh, yeah, it'd be good for making pictures because you try to . Yeah, it's good for making pictures, right? I think, and I mean, I look at myself as a, more of a traditional architecture data center guy, right? There's a lot to learn there. And it moves so quickly, like you said, it's like, okay, I just got this concept down, now we're onto the next, right? Takes time. It does. I don't know if he's the kind of guy that's ever gonna sit down and learn, right? Doesn't seem like that kind of guy. I think he likes what he does and he wants to just keep doing it until he retires at some point. Cause how old do you think he is? Mid fifties. Yeah. Mid fifties. He's either our age or a little bit older. That's the problem with seeing people that are 50 plus, right? Yeah. If you've got a traditional IT people, they're, it's, God, they don't want it. They just want to get through the next five to 10 years and retire. That's what they're thinking. I mean, we know all of them, right? We talk all the time. I just want to get through it and retire. Good luck. Good luck. They're the ones losing their jobs, right? It's our age group losing their jobs cause they're all middle and upper management or they're just viewers that don't need their expertise. Like I told you, my buddy is hanging on at Cargill, for through all the way out forever. But now he's the last man standing that knows this system that's still deployed that they're not going to shut down anytime soon. Yeah. I don't have to learn anything else. I got nobody else to do it. I'm the only one left that knows this system. You can get lucky, man. There's nothing wrong with luck. And it's like, and I- But what if he quit? What would Cargill do if he said, I'm out, I'm done with you guys. There's a- I'll call him. What if Cargill's like, hey, we found a solution, we're migrating all this shit over in the next few weeks. Well, guess what, Bryce? You're going to be out. Hey, man, if you can, don't get me wrong. Professors do it all the time. There's a lot of people at Concordia that should have been fucking gone a long time ago. And I think, I think leadership should, I mean, it's like in education, it's like, you know, you're going to be out. You're going to be out. Education's no different than any corporation in that regard, right? But it's like, you're going to have to make some tough calls on these people. It's just like, you're either helping us accelerate through this space or you're not. It's, I hate, it's literally that simple. Are you a barrier to me or are you an accelerant? It's that, speech I give students often these days. If your skill set's a barrier, that can be fixed. But if they're not seeing that you're fixing it, now you're a barrier. You're a permanent barrier. And if you're like Adam and you're just like, yeah, man, we're going to develop on .net fucking one. And it's fucking great. Wrong answer. You know what I'm telling him? I'm asking him about XML. Fucking liar. There's XML code in, there's XAML code in here. And it's, that's why I was asking him. It was just kind of like, hey, so there's no XA, nope, nope, we're not doing that. Fuck you. I'm looking at it. That was kind of the funny thing in the call. Yeah. You know what I mean? It's so easy just to be like, pull it up. Dude, what the fuck is this? You are using desktop code in a web solution. Fucking explain this to me. You should have said it. No. When he was getting help, he was like, Adam, I'm just confused. Like, what is this code here? I know. You don't want to throw him under the bus. Well, it's not throwing him under the bus. It's also too, given that it's been years of development, he probably forgot. You know what I mean? Just like why there's code keys. I mean, there's access keys to stuff, hard coded in the code. And it's just like, hey guys, just a, that's one I'm bringing up tomorrow, which is like, hey guys, just a couple of things you do have. I get the security of your environment, but I would not put hard coded keys in here. Here they are. It's in these scripts. It's in these lines. Just get them out of there. How are you guys doing key management? Which they're not. You know what I mean? That's where the, it's a challenge. It's a challenge in a small business where you're trying to do all these other things and you're just trying to make it work. You got to give them credit. The shit works. It works. I'll give them a lot of credit, but it's a, he should have asked for help. Brought in a guy like Carl or Ken Sikora and some like that. I'd be like, dude, teach me like modern day software development kind of foundations. And he brought in this guy. He didn't teach him anything new. He's like, no, this is how we do it here. You know what I mean? Yeah. There's no, it is literally just these applications. They all plug into the same database and that's it across endless fucking tables, endless tables. Well, it's funny because why would Brendan wants, if he's a programmer, why would he want to sit there? I have a feeling. Brendan is just like, yeah. Brian wants me to sitten absinthe worden request and I won't harmed. In the face of those guys that you're probably 결과 for about a year or something at a length for the dumb. They have I'm I double amount of time I'm out joining you and this round doesn't hold that ground right across our body. Yeah. He lets us run off. Yep. There's some kind of chip brown paper in it. There are no quick Chicago guys at home. Cause those guys are like. They don't like to flip. you know what I mean it's like he worked for the government he just couldn't hide which is weird in a small company he went on over to Nexus we were small I mean you wore a lot of hats just like you and I have in this company it's weird if you can get away with it but I guess you're right if you can get away with it that's just your demeanor I mean you collect I'm guessing he's making 90,000 bucks maybe 100,000 bucks and you're working 25 hours a week maybe not a bad game don't get me wrong rock on that's why a lot of people end up do you think he's married it sounds like he is but I mean if you're like I don't see him as being very driven or ambitious and he's just like dude I just want to work and I want to walk my there's nothing wrong with that by the way there's nothing wrong with that but it's kind of like it's like Stacy every day you delay you're hurting his development that's the rub when you don't get fucking rid of people you're hurting his development you know what I mean I'll play the game as long as you want but it's just like you really want him to hang around and stay and do this kind of stuff and it's kind of like dude by the way you're going to learn some vibe coding shit what the fuck is that yeah that's a problem as a software developer if you don't even know what the hell I'm talking about you know what I mean that means you're not even reading the fucking news dude I mean you're not even paying attention to your space they're buying time right like we talked about how much time do I have to retire that's all I'm worried about I get it but that's I just view that shit as like stealing man and that's just it's like sniff those people out and be like go you need to go work for the county dude go work for the fucking or uh there's a great opening at uh that Flatley left there's a great opening and they're like uh Minnesota Department of Health go do that and work 38 and a half hours a week maybe maybe I stress maybe there's that's and that's fine don't get me wrong I think we should up our standards in government too but we can't pay shit so that's what you're going to get there's no money right but instead they'll uh hire people and have more 20 hours a week so I think maybe if you bought if you hired the right people and you had less of them they'd actually work I have I have met some absolute rock stars in government and how they do it I don't know like oh I let me tell you I do know why they're doing it the pension and the whatever but I don't know how they do it sitting in meetings all day long be like we've been working on this project for three years it's funny I I so I used to do a lot of stuff I was a part of the DNR back in nexus and there's two or three guys three main dudes that were super sharp right they're older right mid to late 50s I was young so I seemed old and uh they seemed to work pretty good and then a guy that worked for us ended up going to work there and I hooked up with him like two years later or Chad or Brian I can't remember his last name now and he's like dude this is the best job ever like we don't do anything and I was like dude this is the best job ever like we don't do anything that's what he said and I go what do we need to do you know about two or three months out of the year we deploy new things and you know blah blah blah rest of the time we're just supporting we sit around and doing that so they sit around all fucking day drinking coffee it's kinda like what you had talked about right they drink their coffee and they search the web and I gotta sit them down I'll go mess with them all and it's like oh my god and this guy's personality that used to work for me and now he's working for us perfect for this job lazy as they get lazy as they get this guy will even talk this is like Lisa's cousins who are all civil engineers for all counties in the state of Minnesota drive me crazy like Lauren like every time I talk to him hey man what's new he says the same thing he's like nothing and I love it nothing like what's he goes what's going on at the county nothing nothing fucking love it I didn't get the money we wanted this year so all our projects are kind of off so what are you gonna do he goes nothing he goes fucking love it he'll literally tell you he'll be sitting in a county truck yeah we picked up some gravel because some guy's culvert collapsed or you know some shit like that right gonna go dump it fill it in I said then what are you gonna then what do you go do he goes take a nap take a break have lunch maybe fucking take a break take a nap see I just like see like he's like we're just I love Lauren like a brother man that kid's awesome how many six foot eight civil engineers you know right six straight from the farm nobody has any interest in farming nobody picked up the farm they all be they all they're all freaking geniuses they're all engineers and accountants the four children and the three boys are all engineers and the girls and accountants and it's like nice to sell to the earth people ever but it's just like I miss like Lauren when you sit back and you look at life it's fucking coffee a Danish gravel and a fucking sandwich a nap and he just starts laughing he's like abso-fucking-lutely and I'm like dude shoot me he goes I know you could never do that I'm like dude I'd be like why is there a crazy person running naked down the middle of the road because I would lose it I couldn't do it man no I have no ability to do it I have no ability to I'd rather be crazy busy I work way better if I got a lot of energy in the fire and a lot of things going on then not be busy at all yeah yeah I just I I'm empathetic but I don't understand people like Adam and Brendan but I respect it too I wish I was that way I'm just not I am not there's a way to be I think that way is I mean you think you'd want to learn and be more busy like even if I was a cashier I wouldn't want to be a cashier and have nobody come through my my section I'd want a line at the door so I'm just working and moving you know what I mean like they go by that much faster I can't imagine going to work and being like like sitting in the back room who knows what they fiddle with but they're probably not around then I had a dream the other night that I was like 85 fucking years old and you and I have these my dream was like we attended you were there and we were like attending like a board meeting or something there was people around and people were giving us updates and then though but I was also working a second job and I swear to God I'm sitting in Target and I was sitting there Target was empty and I don't know why I was Target because I fucking hate Target and my future is 85 at Target now I'm going to jump out the fucking window but and I was sitting there programming the the robots that were cleaning the floors and stocking the shelves I'm like wait a minute yeah I'm like that's intriguing that I can get down with I'm like where I'm not working I'm working but it's like okay you fuckers we're going to get those M&Ms fucking placed plump plump on the shelves here people here we fucking go alright it's Chris you're not a super healthy robot super speedy I'm like I'm like you're telling me my dreams right now are as to with my with you know with you we're building a bunch of companies which is fine fun but in my spare time I'm working at fucking Target programming robots I'm like I gotta get better dreams man this is some fucked up shit this is some really do you have a blood check or a board meeting? nah I got my shit at Target starts in five hours hold on let me start this frickin code fuckin yeah one of your bots that'll be my next dream one of your bots is chasing kids down the aisle like what the fuck alright I'll hop I'll move over to the board here for the Stacy thing alright see you later see you in a minute
